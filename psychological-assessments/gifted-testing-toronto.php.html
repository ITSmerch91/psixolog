			<h2 class="text-uppercase">Q&A ON GIFTED TESTING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR GREATER TORONTO AREA</h2>

			<p>
				There seems to be a great deal of confusion among parents regarding gifted programs in the public school system, selection criteria, and the various routes of testing children for these programs. This page is intended to provide answers to common questions about the selection process for gifted programs; however, please keep in mind that each school board can have its own process / criteria and can change its procedures and regulations without notice.
			</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="section-box">
						<h4>How are students selected for gifted programs?</h4>
						<p>
							Typically, school boards select students for gifted programs in grade 3, with the placement starting in Grade 4 (note: it is different in the Peel Region and YCDSB). The formation of gifted classes starts around March. The majority of school boards have a multi-stage procedure: First, they administer a paper-and-pencil or computerized aptitude test to all students (e.g.
							<a href="The Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test - information for parents.pdf" title="The Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test (CCAT)" target="_blank">
								<strong>CCAT - Canadian cognitive abilities test</strong></a>
							); then, students with a score above a certain cut-off point are being reviewed by the teachers, who have to fill GRS-S forms rating the student based on Intellectual ability, Academic ability, Creativity, Artistic talent, Leadership ability, and Motivation. Students who have been rated highly by their teachers undergo an individual assessment with the school psychologist (IQ test, typically WISC 5). Based on the results of the individual assessment, those who scored in the top 2 percentiles are offered a place in a gifted class. Due to financial cut-backs, some school boards base their decision solely on the CCAT results and GRS-S ratings. Also, some schools can opt-out from gifted testing entirely at their discretion. In this case, the only option for parents is private testing.
						</p>
						<h4>Can I prepare my child for the test?</h4>
						<p>
							It is possible to prepare a child for the CCAT (e.g., you can use the training for CogAT, it is very similar), but DO NOT try preparing your child specifically for the gifted test, as it will only spoil the results. Familiarity with test questions and instructions will be noticeable, and the examiner will have to mention it in the report, which invalidates the results.
						</p>
						<h4>School screening test vs. IQ test:</h4>
						<p>
							Aptitude tests used for screening are different from formal IQ tests. Unfortunately, some students who are gifted, may not demonstrate high results on the screening aptitude test and, therefore, will not be selected for the gifted program testing. Many children do not do as well when they have to work on a test independently (rather than interactively), or when they are asked to write a test in a large group (30+ students), or they might simply not care enough to try hard on this test. Also, it is known from the parents' reports that some school boards have a quota on the number of children selected for gifted testing from one school. This is because school psychologists are very busy and can test only a limited number of students. In this unfortunate situation, some students who did well on the aptitude test will not have a chance to try an IQ test.
						</p>
						<h4>What if my child didn't pass school screening?</h4>
						<p>
							If your child did not pass the screening for a gifted test with the school psychologist you can start by completing a free online
							<a href="../wpblog/gifted-assessments/index.htm#test" class="text-white" style="text-decoration:underline;" title="gifted screening questionnaire" target="_blank">
								<strong>gifted screening questionnaire</strong></a>
							to evaluate the chances that your child is gifted. If the results of this questionnaire are high enough, it makes sense to have your child take a gifted test through a private psychologist. If the child passed the gifted test privately, the school board IS REQUIRED to place the child in the gifted program or the equivalent program that is used by that school board and the results of the CCAT are disregarded. The formal gifted test by a licensed child psychologist always supersedes the CCAT screening.
						</p>
						<h4>What if my child didn't pass the test with the school psychologist?</h4>
						<p>
							If your child passed the screening process but did not pass the gifted test with the school psychologist, you must
							<strong>wait a year</strong> before attempting to do the test privately. If the one-year interval is not observed, the results of the subsequent test are likely to be disregarded by the school board due to a child's familiarity with test questions. A child who passed a private gifted test
							<strong>can be placed in a gifted program in any grade.</strong>
						</p></div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="section-box">
						<h4>When can I test my child for giftedness?</h4>
						<p>You can test for giftedness at any age (typically 5 years and older), but the following strategy can be recommended depending on parents' goals and situation:</p>
						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>In Grade 1 or 2, have your child complete a
								<a href="cognitive-profile-assessment.php.html" title="Cognitive Profile Assessment" target="_blank">
									<strong>Cognitive Profile Assessment (CPA)</strong></a>
								with a private child psychologist, the results will be helpful whether the child is gifted or not. This assessment evaluates a child's cognitive strengths and weaknesses, and, in addition to practical recommendations on a child's development, the assessment results will give you a good indication of whether your child is likely to be gifted.
							</li>
							<li>Then wait till Grade 3 to have the child complete the screening at school. If your child did not pass school screening for a gifted test but received high IQ estimate on the previously taken CPA assessment (see above), go to a private psychologist, and take the gifted test privately.
							</li>
						</ul>
													<h4>Do I have to transfer my child to a gifted program/class if identified as gifted?</h4>
							<p>You may want to watch this animated video (below) showing how a gifted child feels in a regular school.</p>
							<div id="vid">
								<div id="EVPC"></div>
							</div>

												<h4>Is the gifted program a good choice for any gifted student?</h4>
						<p>
							Gifted classes are highly specialized and very competitive, so they might not be great for all students, especially if the child has some cognitive or emotional weaknesses. Consider your child's personality, cognitive abilities, and social-emotional functioning prior to making this decision. Consult with a specialist if in doubt.
						</p>
						<h4>Do private schools screen students for giftedness?</h4>
						<p>
							No, private schools don't do gifted screening, the only option for parents of these children is to arrange gifted testing with a licensed psychologist in private practice.
						</p>
						<h4>Is private school a reasonable alternative for my gifted child?</h4>
						<p>
							It depends. In most cases, the publicly-funded gifted program is a better choice just because the teachers there are specially trained and the curriculum is designed for gifted learners. Though, there are schools such as the University of Toronto School or Academy For Gifted Children (PACE) in Richmond Hill, that specifically target gifted children.
