					<p>Of all the developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are most strongly linked to genetics. However, etiologic research shows that no single gene is to blame. Nor has any scientific basis been established for widespread opinion that vaccines trigger the condition. Rather, hundreds of genes and a network of complex causes underpin autism, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), the three main types of ASDs specified by the diagnostic manual (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association. This partly explains why ASDs appear across a broad spectrum, and one autistic person cannot function independently while another becomes a competitive musician. Additional risk factors include advanced paternal age, and maternal exposure during pregnancy to medications such as valproate, an epilepsy treatment. Gender also heightens vulnerability; three out of every four individuals diagnosed with an ASD are male.</p>

			<p class="columnize-2">

				ASD vulnerability is established in utero. Environment, however, significantly impacts how and to what extent children are affected by these neurodevelopmental disorders. The sooner children get diagnosed, the greater their chances of benefitting from treatment.<br> Early detection is critical. Autistic children who do not get diagnosed or treated diverge along a learning path that disconnects them from an essential survival skill: the ability to engage in reciprocal relationships. Isolated and impaired, they can become increasingly trapped in trademark ASD symptoms such as repetitive, self-stimulatory behavior, awkward social skills, and fixation on narrow interests.<br> In contrast,<strong>children who are diagnosed and treated early often thrive. Intervening during early developmental stages, when a child's brain is most malleable, can actually attenuate the condition</strong>. Many children with autism flourish in highly defined, predictable situations, making them standouts in fields of math and technology. Others demonstrate unusual artistic and musical aptitudes. An accurate diagnosis can make such achievements possible. Diagnosis is a door opener to a range of services that can mitigate children's weaknesses, maximize their strengths, subsequently enabling them to reach their potential at home and school.

						<p>
							The median age of autism diagnosis is five years old, although members of disadvantaged populations such as minorities and rural dwellers often receive evaluations even later. Those numbers may shift in coming years. Promising emerging technology that tracks eye movements for clues to mental functioning is now making it possible to screen babies as young as three-months old.Until this technology become cost-effective and widely accessible, cognitive assessments offer the most reliable diagnoses of ASDs.</p>

						<h6>They are focusing on the following objectives:</h6>


						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>Obtaining an accurate diagnosis by interpreting patterns of symptoms and impairment</li>
							<li>Targeting areas for intervention</li>
							<li>Customizing a course of treatment</li>
							<li>Establishing appropriate educational supports</li>
							<li>Gaining insight into the child's inner world and finding points of relational connection</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Gauging a child's progress through normal developmental milestones is one purpose of pediatric wellness visits typically scheduled between a child's birth and third birthday. During these appointments, physicians look for early indicators of developmental delays such as those typically found among autistic children. Sadly, not all doctors screen for early detection or pay attention to caregiver's concerns. A parent who raises questions about a child's speech delays, failure to make eye contact, and disconnection from peers may be dismissed with explanations that the child has a learning disability, behavior problem, or is simply just eccentric. If symptoms remain undetected and children fall through the cracks, children miss opportunities to receive treatment early, when it is most beneficial. Therefore, it is important that parents with persistent concerns trust their instincts and pursue further evaluation, even if a primary doctor minimizes their concerns.

							One free, scientifically-proven assessment that parents can request between the ages of 16 and 30 months is the Modified Autism Checklist in Toddlers-Revised, with Follow Up (M-CHAT-R/F). Routinely administered by most pediatricians.
						</p>



						<h4>this screening test contains the following two components:</h4>

						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>A questionnaire that estimates autism risk based on parental answers to twenty questions</li>
							<li>A follow-up questionnaire administered to medium-risk children soon after the first evaluation in order to gain added information necessary to confirm needs for more testing</li>
						</ul>



						<p>Results from a study of 16,000 children screened with the M-CHAT-R/F show that its value extends beyond early identification of autism. Among those determined to be at medium to high risk (a combined total of 6% of participants), 47% met autism diagnostic criteria, and 95% were found to have a different developmental delay.
						</p>

						<h4>Screening instruments for toddlers and preschoolers:</h4>

						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT)</li>
							<li>Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)</li>
							<li>Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS)</li>

						<p>An unusual score confirms the need for a comprehensive evaluation such as formal testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder. Core impairments associated with autism appear in early childhood, but disorders such as Asperger's and PDD-NOS become evident later.</p>



						<h4>Three behavioral criteria required for diagnosis:</h4>
						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>Motor issues such as repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, restricted interests</li>
							<li>Qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interactions</li>
							<li>Deficits in communication that include delayed language or non- interactive conversations</li>
						</ul>



						<p>No individual Autism test, rating system or observation can provide a complete diagnosis. Rather, a comprehensive evaluation must be based on qualitative and quantitative information drawn from various sources and analyzed by a multidisciplinary team.</p>

						<h4>Experts who are qualified to collaborate in the effort:</h4>
						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>Pediatrician</li>
							<li>Neuropediatrics specialist</li>
							<li>Neurologist</li>
							<li>Psychologist</li>
							<li>Speech Language pathologist</li>
							<li>Neurologist</li>
							<li>Audiologist</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Most evaluation techniques measure a child's functioning from a developmental, environmental and family standpoint.</p>



						<h4>Characteristics taken into consideration:</h4>

						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>Hyper focus on particular objects or topics</li>
							<li>Limited imagination and capacity for creative play</li>
							<li>Excessive dependence on rituals and routines</li>
							<li>Struggles to start and sustain a conversation</li>

						<p>There are myriad assessment tools; the child's age and needs determine which will yield the most accurate results.</p>
						<h4>Several frequently employed instruments:</h4>
						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) Results are based on answers to an interview conducted in the child's home or a clinic</li>

							<li>Prelinguistic Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Results are generated from an observation scale designed to diagnose children who do not yet use phrase speech</li>
							<li>Childhood Autism Rating Scale Results are based on observing the child's behavior throughout the day
							</li>
							<li>Autism Behavior Checklist Results provide a general measure of autism risk</li>
							<li>Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Results are based on answers to a checklist</li>
							<li>Real Life Rating Scale Results are based on a measurement scale of treatment effects on 47 behaviors across social, motor, affective, language, and sensory domains</li>
							<li>Pervasive Developmental Disorder Screening Test Results are based on a parent report screening test
							</li>
							<li>Autism Screening Instrument for Educational Planning (2nd ed.)</li>
							<li>Diagnostic Checklist for Behavior-Disturbed Children (Form E-2) Results differentiate between children with "classical" autism and children who simply exhibit "autistic-like" features</li>
							<li>Gilliam Autism Rating Scale Results diagnose presence and severity of autism</li>
						</ul>



						<p>Beyond diagnosis, comprehensive ASD evaluations also assess children's functioning in areas that include the following:</p>



						<ul class="list-chevrons">
							<li>Adaptability / Daily Living skills</li>
							<li>Communication skills</li>
							<li>Intelligence</li>
							<li>Information-processing skills</li>
							<li>Academic achievement</li>
							<li>Sensory behaviors</li>
							<li>Family assessments used to gauge changes before and after testing</li>
							<li>Medical evaluations aimed at ruling out other conditions that might impair learning ability</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Assessment results examine a child's symptoms, skills and levels of impairment or disability. This information shows where he or she falls on the ASD spectrum that ranges from "high functioning" to "profoundly delayed". Results also provide a baseline and point of comparison against which to measure developmental progress and intervention efficacy.</p>

			<h2 class="text-uppercase">AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS: NEXT STEPS</h2>

			<p class="columnize-2">Autism spectrum disorders are chronic conditions, but they are not static. With treatment, some children improve and no longer meet diagnostic criteria. Others learn to communicate more fluidly while some seem to make little if any progress. All three groups can benefit from acquiring fresh assessments periodically. Parents of children who begin developing normally can make sure gains are maintained and intervene quickly if symptoms reoccur. Children who face lifelong challenges have an even more critical need for ongoing assessment. Evaluations are necessary to update a child's profile, ensuring that interventions and educational plans stay current, flexible and tailored to meet the child's changing needs and goals.
