					<section class="section-box">
						<p>
							Children have a limited capacity to express their feelings with words. Because of this, child therapy relies on other mediums, such as play, art, creativity, drama, etc. In the process of therapy, children learn to express their emotions and resolve their conflicts in more adaptive ways. They learn new modes of relating to others, develop a stronger sense of self and self-worth, and learn to cope with challenges in their lives. Parent participation and cooperation in the process plays a pivotal role in successful therapy. The duration of treatment differs widely from child to child, and can take from 8 weeks to several years, depending on the severity of the problem, presence of obstacles to recovery, regularity of attendance, and family support throughout the process.

					<label>EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Children's emotional struggles are addressed through a combination of play therapy, art therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, parent-child work, family work and parent coaching. The process begins with a parent interview (it is advisable for both parents to attend) to understand the nature of the concerns and evaluate how the child and family function in various aspects of life. This is followed by a brief assessment of the child's social-emotional functioning (3-4 sessions), which helps us understand the problem and provides access to a child's inner world, identity, attachment style, resources, and coping mechanisms. These initial sessions also help to build rapport with the child, so that they feel comfortable and safe in the therapy room. This is followed by parent feedback and counselling / therapy.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="toggle">
					<label>BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Sometimes children act in ways that are the opposite of what they have been taught by parents and teachers. Some children passively disobey adults while others have severe outbursts with screaming, insults, destroying property, hurting others or self, or running away. It is very difficult for the parents to help a child at such moments, as they become angry themselves and feel helpless as the child does not respond to either rewards or threats. The first step in dealing with behavioral issues is to understand their origin. Bad behavior can be triggered by anxiety, jealousy, unmet emotional needs, sensory or cognitive overload, marital problems between the parents, and other situational causes. However, in some cases, they may result from a neurological condition, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, or Autism Spectrum Disorder. The initial assessment of a child's and family functioning plays a crucial role in prescribing the right type of treatment and for making referrals to other services, if necessary.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="toggle">
					<label>LIFE CHANGES</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Children can have a strong reaction to both negative and positive life changes. However, due to their limited ability to understand and express their emotions, children might show their feelings in unusual ways or not show them at all. For example, upon the birth of a sibling, a child might regress to infantile behaviors, such as bed wetting or demanding to be spoon fed, in an attempt to attract the same kind of affection as his baby brother. Sometimes, children might adopt a behavior that is the opposite of what they really need. For example, after parental divorce some children start acting in a protective manner towards their parent, although it is actually the child who feels abandoned and in need of protection. These maladaptive patterns can become entrenched and can transfer to many other situations and relationships in a person's life. It is crucial to consult with a psychologist/psychotherapist whenever your child faces a major life transition, whether or not they show concerning symptoms. In cases where the child has suffered a traumatic event such as serious illness, bereavement, or abuse, immediate attention is required.

				<div class="toggle">
					<label>SOCIAL INTERACTIONS</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							The ability to form secure and enjoyable relationships with peers relies on self-esteem, positive early experience in relationships with attachments figures, the ability to tolerate and deal with conflicts, and interest in other people and topics/ activities that are common for that age. Helping a child overcome social struggles requires a thorough understanding of these factors. Through interviews, observation and projective techniques, a therapist will get a sense of the child's personality, inner resources, and learned relational patterns, and can devise a therapeutic plan to address any obstacles. Such targeted intervention is usually more effective than the popular approach of teaching social skills. Most often, parents and siblings are also involved at various stages of therapy.

					<label>ADHD COUNSELLING</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Individuals with ADHD differ dramatically in their level of adjustment and satisfaction with life. This can vary from child to child, depending on the degree to which he has learned to manage his symptoms and the degree of acceptance and understanding by family and teachers. ADHD can lead to an array of secondary problems, including behavioral acting out, underachievement, anxiety, social problems, bullying, explosiveness, poor judgement, etc. While it is impossible to eliminate ADHD deficits without medication, therapy and counselling can be very helpful in addressing the secondary issues related to ADHD. It can help a child achieve a greater self-awareness, determine what makes their symptoms worse, find healthier ways to expresses their emotions and learn to modulate their behavior by conscious choice. All of these will lead to better self-esteem and greater adjustment. Additionally, parents of ADHD children often benefit from professional advice and coaching.

					<label>COUNSELLING FOR GIFTED CHILDREN</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Gifted children often possess traits that make it hard for them to adjust to and function in the real world. They are often emotionally intense, hyper-focused on their own ideas, seeking constant stimulation, getting easily bored, socially immature or even awkward, unconcerned about the practicalities of life, exhaustingly chatty, etc. Additionally, these children are often prone to perfectionism, anxiety, self-criticism, and depression. It appears that the disparity between their advanced intellectual skills and normal or subnormal emotional development is responsible for these struggles, as they are often overwhelmed by the information they absorb from their environment and by their own thoughts. Gifted children and their parents benefit greatly from counselling by a professional who is experienced in working with this population.

					<label>ADOLESCENT ISSUES</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Adolescence is the most turbulent, challenging and exciting time of life. In this critical period, young people are extremely vulnerable to anxiety, depression, addiction, suicide, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. At the time when they need adult guidance the most, adolescents feel compelled to reject parental help and turn instead to friends or internet resources. Counselling provides a great opportunity for adolescents to benefit from interactions with an accepting and compassionate adult who can help them resolve their issues, define their identity and values, and formulate reasonable goals and plans. In many cases, serious mental health issues can be prevented with effective counselling. It is important for parents to understand that their teenage child should be willing to participate in counselling and that the teenager should have the autonomy to decide about the purpose and goals of such counselling. Privacy is extremely important for adolescents and is essential for the development of a trusting relationship between them and the therapist.

					<label>COUNSELLING FOR YOUTH WITH AUTISM</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Autism is a developmental condition and, therefore, it cannot be cured. Children with this syndrome experience a variety of deficits and challenges that impact their daily life. They have a hard time expressing and understanding emotions, reading non-verbal cues, figuring out the intentions of others, understanding jokes and sarcasm, engaging appropriately with peers, etc. As a result, they often feel isolated from others, which causes them considerable distress. Through various activities, a therapist can help an autistic child develop their lacking social skills, thus improving their ability to adapt to social environments. Parents and teachers of these children also require ongoing guidance as the needs of the children change over time. It is advisable for parents of an autistic child to connect with a professional who will be able to follow up after the intensive part of therapy is over, so that the child will develop a long-term connection with that person.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-8">


					<section class="section-box">
						<p>
							While there are many reasons why an adult might choose to seek psychotherapy, the primary benefit experienced by patients is universal: The presence of an objective but empathetic professional who offers supportive one-on-one interaction, providing both insight and acceptance. This helps to relieve the sense of loneliness and shame which often accompanies emotional and psychological issues, and from there, healing can begin.

						<p>
							While there are many theoretical and practical approaches to psychotherapy, research has consistently shown that regardless of the approach, the most powerful factor in predicting the outcomes of therapy is the quality of the therapeutic relationship between the psychotherapist and the patient.
						</p>
						<p>
							During a psychotherapy session, a skillful therapist usually employs a combination of different techniques, such as active listening, validation of experience and feelings, rephrasing and summarizing, questioning that directs the client on the quest of self-discovery, education, and provision of tools and methods needed to progress on to a healthier and more functional way of living, etc.
						<p>
							The power of the therapeutic process is rooted directly within the human brain; just as learning alters the brain on a structural level - creating new neural pathways - therapy literally "re-trains" the inner workings of the mind by providing a person with a new way to experience the self and their relationship with others. It is a myth that therapy consists only of confiding in someone who listens without judging and offers advice (though this is a valuable aspect of it). In reality, therapists utilize complex modalities like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT), Person Centered Therapy (PCT) and/or Meaning-Centered Therapy, to directly alter how the patient is perceiving the world and reacting to it. An experienced psychotherapist chooses an integrative approach that includes a combination of different modalities that best suits their patient. During CBT, for example, the therapist helps the patient identify patterns of maladaptive cognition, recognize them when they are occurring, and change the beliefs and reactions which underlie these patterns. Doing so allows the patient to regain control over his or her dysfunctional behaviours.
						</p>
						<p>
							Person-centered therapy, on the other hand, puts the focus more strongly on listening to the patient - as he or she is viewed as being the best authority on his or her own experience - and discovering what kind of conditions that patient requires in order to grow. PCT recognizes that sometimes, adverse conditions lead individuals to develop dysfunctional behaviours in an attempt to, for instance, gain acceptance and positive regard from others, distancing them from their own true desires and motivations. Patients in this position are guided in such a way that allows them to reconnect with their own experience and rediscover an authentic sense of meaning, allowing them to change their behaviours to better reflect their needs. While therapy is a gradual process for everyone, the length of time it takes for each individual patient to heal tends to vary greatly. Many "single event" issues (e.g. a loss or trauma) can be resolved within a relatively short span of time, while chronic conditions (mental illnesses or the effects of severe, repeated abuse) may require many years of therapy. However, in all cases, the goal is to minimize the patient's need for therapy as much as is possible - allowing him or her to focus on leading a productive, fulfilling life.

					<label>COUPLE AND MARRIAGE COUNSELLING</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Couples, as any other relationship, evolve and get strained by life's challenges and tensions. During the first period of the marriage issues with routines, daily life, finances, friends, in-laws and sex have to be negotiated and established. Life transitions such the arriving of children, job losses, sickness, rebellious teenagers and grief could add major stress to the marital system. If not negotiated or addressed properly, miscommunication, animosity and disappointment for the unmet expectations can arise affecting the couple's dynamic and creating emotional distance between partners. Common marital concerns are lack of communication, personality differences, irritability and moodiness, disagreements about parenting, issues with extended family, lack of trust, boredom, sex and infidelity, among others. Couple therapy is recommended in these cases.
						</p>
						<p>
							Marital or couple therapy is an intervention which facilitates resolving misunderstandings, learning how to compromise and developing a closer and healthier relationship with each other. All issues pertaining to the marital relationship could be addressed and properly resolved with therapeutic help and willingness of both partners.
						</p>
						<p>
							Couple therapy can also facilitate ending the relationship if the couple feels this is the direction they would like to take. In this case therapy may help negotiate a soft transition to separation/divorce.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the first session the therapist will help partners to identify the major issues affecting the couple's interaction, provide feedback and agree with them about the scope of work and the goals. Typically both partners come together to the first session but a private discussion with one or both of them is also possible. The couple therapist will create a neutral, safe and flexible environment for partners to talk to each other, share their feelings and openly discuss their frustrations. An effective couple therapy intervention might help partners to substantially improve communication and trust repairing their bond.
						</p>
						<p>The number of sessions needed in the treatment for couple therapy varies and it is discussed and determined by both the clients and the therapist.

					<label>FAMILY THERAPY</label>
					<div class="toggle-content">
						<p>
							Family therapy is a systemic based therapeutic approach that uses the strengths of the family to address individual or family issues. Family therapy is "interactional based" which means that healthy family relationships are at the core of the psychological well being of children and parents. As a traditional form of brief psychotherapy, family therapy entails direct participation of parents and children. Family therapy is recommended for all kinds of emotional problems, communicational issues and parenting challenges that involve parents and children. Misbehavior at home or school, underperforming at school, children's anxiety and depression, supporting children with special needs including ADHD or ADD, self esteem issues, oppositional behaviour, angry teenagers, and differences in parenting styles are only a few examples of the type of problems that could be successfully addressed in family therapy.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the first session the therapist together with the family will conduct an assessment of the family's presenting problems and strengths and define the scope, length and goals for the treatment. Often clients experience changes in their perception and understanding of the problem right away. Further relief of the symptoms occurs throughout the therapeutic intervention. The family member who is symptomatic is liberated of the problematic concerns with the support of his/ her family. Once therapeutic goals are achieved usually the parents are on the same page and communication within the family flows easily. The number of sessions needed in the treatment for family therapy varies and it is discussed and determined by both the clients and the therapist.
