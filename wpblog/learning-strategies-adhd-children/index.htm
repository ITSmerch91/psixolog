          <p>Do you remember sitting through 3-hour long lecture classes in college and thinking about everything other than whatever topic the professor was covering? Can you think of a time that you had an hour-long conversation with your best friend, where she carried on and on about something that you can’t remember because you weren’t really paying attention to her? Let’s admit it, adults have difficulty focusing at times, whether it’s listening to a wife complaining  that the trash isn’t taken out or paying attention to your child’s story about the latest video game. Now, imagine a child suffering from ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) trying to learn in school or complete homework at night.</p>
<p>There is a significant amount of distractions in a classroom environment for any young student. Students are distracted by each other, by what’s going on in the hallway or even outside their classroom window. In addition, sitting still, remaining quiet and having to focus on one task at a time can be very challenging for any student let alone a child with ADHD.</p>
<p>For many parents, the first hurdle in dealing with an ADHD child is <a title="Principal Symptoms of ADHD in Children and Teenagers" href="../principal-symptoms-of-adhd-in-children-and-teenagers/index.htm" target="_blank">coping with the diagnosis</a>. No parents want to see their child struggle in any way, but it is imperative that parents accept the reality. It is important to accept that your child has ADHD; you will need to provide the help your child requires in order to succeed academically and personally. Many still believe in common societal misconceptions that ADHD is just a convenient label for a child, who is lazy and not very smart. Unfortunately, when the child’s struggles are left unrecognized, this is exactly what they will eventually believe.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Here are eight learning strategies to help your ADHD child:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Seat your child <b><i>away from possible distractions</i></b>. Have your child complete homework in a space that isn’t near a window, door or in the vicinity of a television or his/her siblings. If you have a pet, make sure that pet is in the company of other family members and in another room. Having your child sit in a quiet area will enable them to concentrate without the distraction of loud or attention-grabbing noises.</p>
<p><b>2.<i> Balance active and inactive tasks</i></b> to help your child learn. For example, your child may have to sit and complete a math worksheet. After this assignment is completed, have your child complete work that requires them to move around, whether it’s creating a collage, a poster or a science experiment. After a child has been required to sit and concentrate for a period of time, it is best to complete a task that allows them to expend some energy. Even if the work requires them to go to different places in the home to obtain materials to complete the assignment, it will give your child the chance to move around and increase your child’s ability to refocus on the task at hand when given a small break.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Allow your child to <b><i>take frequent breaks</i></b>. Do not force your child to complete one assignment right after the next. If you push your child to complete his/her work without breaks, your child may act out, have an increasingly difficult time concentrating or even refuse to do the work at all. To prevent this, incorporate frequent breaks for your child. Once your child completes one task, give them ten minutes to play (granting the opportunity to release more energy). If possible, it would be best to not allow a child to watch television for multiple reasons; a TV program runs at least 30 minutes and once one show is over, it is very likely a child will wish to watch another episode or two and lose the desire as well as the ability to return to the work area to complete the rest of the work. Additionally, make sure that your child utilizes breaks to hydrate, go to the bathroom or eat (depending on the family schedule).</p>
<p><b>4.<i> Dividing a big task into smaller ones</i></b> is another learning strategy that you can employ with a child with ADHD. For anyone, there are times when a big task can be overwhelming and seem incredibly difficult. Thus, it’s essential for parents to make something big into something smaller. For example, if your child has a week-long project, write down clear and smaller objectives for your child to complete each day. Make these goals clear, concise and keep them right where your child can see them. Have your child check off a goal once it has been accomplished; this will increase your child’s confidence and enable your child to succeed in achieving the end result. Not only will this work with big projects, but daily assignments as well. When you create a specific aim for your child, you are encouraging him/her to focus on one thing. Once your child has completed the first aim, create the next goal for your child to focus on finishing. When you break up an assignment, you are giving your child the chance to focus on separate tasks rather than blending it all into one.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Provide your child with a <b><i>stress ball, a block or a small bean bag</i></b> that they can keep in hand. This strategy will help with the hyperactivity. Holding  something in hand will allow your child to release excessive energy and tension. Squeezing a stress ball may calm your child and allow them to concentrate on what’s important.</p>
<p><b>6.<i> Guide your child through the process</i></b>. Do not point out that the child is not paying attention. In order to encourage your child to focus, lead with directive questions, such as “Can you show me how you would do the next problem? How would you solve…? Can you tell me how you did that?” Engaging your child in the activity is a great way to keep them interested and focused. Additionally, it is a wonderful way for parents to connect with their child. Not only are you getting your child to focus, but you are getting to learn their cognitive process as well as how they are doing in a particular subject area. Redirection is an extremely beneficial strategy to assist your child with ADHD to learn. However, do not assist your child with homework if you get easily frustrated and end up fighting with your child.</p>
<p><b>7.<i> Modeling behavior</i></b> will help your child with ADHD to learn. If you want your child to sit down at the table to begin his/her work, have a seat first and get settled as well . Invite your child to join you; this will increase the likelihood that your child will imitate your behavior. If you are working with your child and need to look something up, do it and make sure your child is watching you. When your child sees you do something and it is helpful, it will encourage your child to mimic your actions in the future. If you are working on a word problem, model how to break the problem down into steps to make it easier to successfully complete. Be consistent with the behaviors you model to increase the chances of your child adopting them and repeating them on his/her own.</p>
<p><b>8.<i> Positive reinforcement</i></b> is another strategy to use to help your child learn. When you see your child demonstrating behavior that will aid in his/her learning success, praise your child. Children are eager to please and will repeat behaviors that are rewarding for them as well as make their parents happy. If you see your child doing work quietly or really concentrating, complement him/her. You can say, “I love the way you are working so quietly” or “I think it’s great that you took the time to show all your work on that division problem”. Specifying your positive feedback allows children to identify what behavior(s) are being admired and encourages those same behaviors to be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>Helping your child with ADHD will not always be easy, but it will be worth it. With the right support and understanding children with ADHD can achieve academic and personal success despite their challenges. Take the time to discover the way your child learns best. The most successful strategies that you will find adhere to your child’s individual learning style and needs. Every child is different, so what may work for one child may not work for another. In order for your child with ADHD to learn, you must always be patient, compassionate and sensitive.</p>
