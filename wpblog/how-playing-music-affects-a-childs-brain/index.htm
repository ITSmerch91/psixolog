          <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I recently stumbled upon the article "Music Lessons Increase IQ" written by my former UofT professor Dr. Glenn Schellenberg and published at "Psychological Science". His research studies show that 3 years of weekly music lessons resulted in 6-7% increase in IQ in 9 year olds. This research findings highlight the importance of music for developing child's brain. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> </em></p>
<p>Music is a fundamental part of the human experience; nearly all children are overjoyed when they discover the gift of music, happily stringing together a few notes on their first recorder or clumsily experimenting with the keys on the family piano.</p>
<p>For parents, it's difficult to know how far to take these early stirrings of musical inclination; music lessons (and musical instruments) are expensive, and of course, not every child who shows an interest in the piano at age four will go on to become a concert pianist. Many parents fear that they may end up wasting a lot of time and money on a temporary diversion which will not benefit their child significantly in the long run if they invest heavily in a musical education.</p>
<p>According to recent research, such fears are largely unfounded; even if a child does not go on to pursue music seriously—and indeed, even if he or she ceases to play altogether at some point—being educated musically from a young age has profound benefits for the mind. While it's not true that listening to music as an infant or young child can make a person “smarter”, scientists are amassing a significant body of evidence which suggests that playing music during childhood can indeed improve brain function.</p>
<p>Researchers at Concordia University, for example, have found that placing a child into music lessons prior to the age of seven leads to the <em><strong>development of <a href="../child-executive-functioning/index.htm" target="_blank">better planning and motor skills</a></strong></em>. Tests also revealed that children who receive musical training at an early age are better able to complete tasks which require very accurate timing.</p>
<p>The aforementioned skills have profound benefits which extend far beyond the music room; not only does having, for example, quicker reflexes and a better sense of timing mean a child might well grow up to be a better driver—able to react rapidly and avoid danger—scientists have discovered that being able to read music effectively often gives a child an edge linguistically. <strong><em>Our brains process music and language similarly</em></strong>, so developing an accurate sense of rhythm and cadence translates into having a better understanding of spoken language. This in turn enhances a child's ability to read, as only through having a good working knowledge of nuances like the flow of syllables and where words ought to begin and end can one properly grasp written language.</p>
<p>Musically-inclined children often do better in school due to the aforementioned abilities, along with having a greater edge when it comes to paying attention to auditory information and a better memory overall. Interestingly, these benefits have been found to last well into old age, and research suggests they may even help to combat age-related hearing difficulties.</p>
<p>According to Nina Krause, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University, music therefore also greatly enhances a person's communication skills. Not only does this give one a strong advantage professionally, people with better communication skills have been shown to have a higher level of social and emotional well-being on average.</p>
<p>Krause believes that this is due to the fact that how we interact socially is strongly tied to our sense of self, and it is our sense of self which forms the basis of our confidence and self esteem—especially while we're still developing. If a child's sense of self is strengthened prior to his or her teen years, he or she will be able to interact with others more positively, setting the stage for enriching relationships which further bolster his or her sense of value.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1320" src="../wp-content/uploads/12891848414_f3d0842568_z.jpg" alt="Music and Child's Brain" width="640" height="512"></p>
<p>Music is a direct source of pride as well; a child who becomes musically skilled has a unique talent to show off to his or her friends, gaining acceptance and admiration. It's important for parents to understand that all young people seek a “role” socially to help them define themselves—the rebel, the class clown, the popular one, the smart one, etc.—so being musically adept gives a young person a safe, positive niche amongst his or her peers. Music even helps children to better tolerate constructive criticism (as performances are routinely assessed and areas for improvement are pointed out) and thus they become better able to rebound from failures.</p>
<p>Music, being a wonderful vehicle of creative self-expression for a young person, also encourages the development of other creative skills. A love of music may lead a child into dance, into the theatre, into the school or church choir, etc. Ergo, even if music does not end up being your child's one true creative passion, it may well be the thing which leads him or her to finding something that is.</p>
<p>Additionally, music is an excellent mood regulation tool, research finds that young adults, who had musical training as children, have lower <a href="../child-and-teen-anxiety/index.htm" target="_blank">rates of anxiety disorder</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the irrefutable fact that music is simply fun; at the end of the day when a child is tired or stressed out, playing a joyful tune may be all he or she needs to do to find a little levity. During special occasions, a shy child will often find a way to warm up to people through playing music for those present. <strong><em>Music, like all creative pursuits, has the ability to transport us to a different place—one of beauty, magic, tranquility, drama, or whatever else we wish.</em> <em>Above all else, music teaches a child to dream, to sail away on the notes and imagine worlds full of potential.</em></strong></p>
