          <p>Childhood-onset <a title="Schizophrenia" href="../mental-disorders/schizophrenia/index.htm" target="_blank">schizophrenia</a> differs from adult-onset schizophrenia and schizophrenia that is first manifested in individuals in adolescence. Adolescent-onset schizophrenia occurs before the age of 17 years, and childhood-onset schizophrenia is delineated as emerging prior to the age of 12 years. Schizophrenia, generally, is <strong style="line-height: 1.4em;"><em>characterized by positive and negative symptoms</em></strong>.  The symptoms that emerge with the onset of schizophrenia in childhood and adolescence are generally the same as those that appear with adult schizophrenia.  Positive symptoms, specifically, include those that can be represented by behaviors that are added to the normal presentation of an individual, and negative symptoms comprise those behaviors that are deficits with regard to normal behavior.  Positive symptoms include, but are not limited to, delusions and hallucinations, as well as symptoms of a formal thought disorder, including rapid or pressured speech.  Negative symptoms include flat affect, or diminished emotional expression, poor hygiene, a lack of motivation and poverty of speech.</p>
<p>Prior to making a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia, <strong><em>the clinician should rule out disorders such as autism, bipolar disorder</em></strong> and patterns of behavior or the lack of them that can be asserted to be indicative of developmental delays.  Parents of a child who may be schizophrenic should be concerned about deviant behavior in their child.  However, they should resist the tendency to pathologize their child by interpreting the child’s behavior as outside of what may be expected in children with ordinary problems.</p>
<p>There are specific ways that distinguish childhood-onset schizophrenia from adolescent-onset schizophrenia.  The earliest indications of schizophrenia in children include <strong><em>delays in language development, late locomotion, such as walking and crawling, and other abnormal behaviors, such as rocking</em></strong>, although one can see that such behaviors are not sufficient to diagnose the child as schizophrenic.  Other more serious signs of schizophrenia include hearing voices that speak negatively to the child, or auditory hallucinations, voices talking about him, including delusions of reference, and being frightened by visions of things that are not actually there, such as visual hallucinations.  These symptoms, generally, may represent issues of concern to the parents of a child or adolescent who may be schizophrenic.  Nevertheless, the parent or the clinician should be hesitant to exaggerate the severity of odd behaviors:  <strong><em>a child may simply have a creative and colorful imagination, as opposed to schizophrenia</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The diagnostic criteria used to address the problems of schizophrenia in children and adolescents are similar to that used for adults, but there are some differences.  In adolescents, schizophrenic symptoms may include: <strong><em>withdrawal from family and peers, a diminished academic performance, problems with sleeping, irritability or depression, lack of motivation and odd behavior.</em></strong>  Again, these types of behavior may reflect relatively normal behavior in an adolescent who is adjusting to roles implicit in maturational development.  The schizophrenic adolescent, as compared with an adult, is <strong><em>less likely to manifest delusions, but is more likely to have visual hallucinations</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Children suspected as having schizophrenia may have difficulty in differentiating dreams from reality, and they may confuse television with reality.  They may have vivid and bizarre thoughts and ideas.  They may <strong><em>demonstrate severe moodiness, regression to earlier stages of development, and they may have difficult peer relationships</em></strong>.</p>
<p>As indicated, the parent and the clinician should be very careful before attributing diagnostic labels to their child.  Diagnoses often lead to the prescription of medication, and, while medication may be the method of choice for treating psychiatric disorders, the use of medication may not be the first choice in treatment of odd behaviors that appear to represent the possibility of schizophrenia in childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>One way of determining a diagnosis of schizophrenia is the use of assessment tools in an effort to satisfactorily address the characteristics residing in the schizophrenic presentation.  These reflect primarily instruments relying on the self-report of the youth and her parents and the interviewing of a youth and her parents when there exists the suggestion of a schizophrenic diagnosis in a child or an adolescent.  Such assessment tools include the following:  The Structured Clinical Interview for the purpose of obtaining a DSM-IV diagnosis.  (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon &amp; Williams, 1992.); The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, (BPRS; Overall &amp; Gorman, 1962.); The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay, Opler &amp; Fitzbein, 1987.); The Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and The Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, (Andreasen, 1982)</p>
<p>The <a href="../../Error/NotFound.html?ItemId=8811" target="_blank"><strong><em>Structured Clinical Interview</em></strong></a>, (SCID), allows the clinician to delineate a diagnosis through interview of the client and her parents.  The information derived by the clinician includes the following:  family history of psychiatric problems, developmental history, academic performance, past treatment, chief complaint, past psychiatric history of the client, substance abuse problems, history of hospitalizations, medications tried and used, medical history, and diagnoses that have been ruled out, as well as an assessment of overall functioning.   This information should enable a clinician to render a diagnosis.  As indicated by research, ( Lobbertael, Leurgans &amp; Artz, 2010), this type of interview allows for moderate to excellent inter-rater reliability, or agreement regarding derivation of diagnoses by clinicians.  This means that the clinician using the SCID will demonstrate reliability in terms of accuracy in diagnostic formulations.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../view/bprs-brief-psychiatric-rating-scale.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale</em></strong></a>, (BPRS), is another instrument that is used to determine a diagnosis of schizophrenia in children and adolescents.  This assessment instrument, like the SCID, relies on an interview of a client and her parents.  This instrument determines the manifestation of symptoms of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.  Symptoms assessed include hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity, all of which can be seen in an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Clearly, the BPRS is useful in deriving a diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../wiki/Positive_and_Negative_Syndrome_Scale.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale</em></strong></a>, (PANSS), also targets the severity of positive symptoms and negative symptoms.  As indicated, positive symptoms include delusions and hallucinations, for example, and negative symptoms include social withdrawal, flat affect or diminished emotion in terms of facial expression, and confused or odd speech.  This scale delineates not only the existence of positive and negative symptoms, it allows for an assessment of the severity of these symptoms, and, as a matter of course, it will render a diagnosis of schizophrenia or the dismissal of such a diagnosis.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../wiki/Scale_for_the_Assessment_of_Positive_Symptoms.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms</em></strong></a>, (SAPS), and the <a href="../../wiki/Scale_for_the_Assessment_of_Negative_Symptoms.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms</em></strong></a>, (SANS), were both developed by Andreasen, (1982) as instruments that utilize interview techniques.  The SAPS assesses for the presence of positive symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions and bizarre behavior.  The SANS assesses negative symptoms, such as flat affect, poverty of speech, poor grooming and hygiene, loss of interest in formerly pleasurable activities, poor relationships with peers and friends and deficits in attention.</p>
<p>Overall, it should be noted that there clearly exist some concerns in diagnosing children and adolescents with the serious psychotic disorder of schizophrenia.  However, there are reliable assessment instruments by which a clinician may render the <a title="Truth about Schizophrenia" href="../truth-about-schizophrenia/index.htm" target="_blank">determination of a schizophrenic diagnosis</a>.  Parents who are concerned about what may seem to be the abnormal behavior of their child should be able to go to a clinician who will be able to make such a diagnosis and rule out other diagnoses.  Ultimately, that is the point at which efficacious treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents may begin.</p>
