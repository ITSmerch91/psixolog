        </div><div class="af-right">
          <p>While taking drugs has always been risky, the introduction of new, more powerful drugs in recent years has heightened the potential for accidental overdose. As the tragic death of Chloe Kotval (a 14 year old girl from Ottawa, Canada) demonstrated, teenagers- even very young teenagers- are not immune to the perils of today’s “designer drugs.” All it took was one pill laced with the potent opiate fentanyl to end Chloe’s life. </p>
<p>With the dangers posed by today’s narcotics (both illicit and prescription), preventing adolescent experimentation with drugs is of the utmost importance… But it’s no easy task. Drug taking is, after all, not a product of moral failure on the part of teens or their parents. Experimentation usually arises from natural human curiosity and addiction is a disease rooted in biochemical abnormalities, not personality. <strong><em>It’s a myth that all drug users come from broken homes or have character defects; many otherwise happy and normal teens simply end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</em></strong> They’re introduced to something that feels good, increases their social standing at school, and makes them feel sophisticated and grown up; before they know it, they’re hooked. </p>
<p>While there is no way to absolutely guarantee that your child will never fall into the trap described above, there is a lot you can do to give your child defenses against temptation. To effectively arm your child in the war against drugs, try using the strategies outlined below:</p>
<h2>1. Start educating your child about the dangers of drug use at a young age.</h2>
<p>Many parents make the mistake of waiting until their child is 13 or 14 to start discussing the perils of drug use. With children as young as 13 and 14 dying from overdoses, that is evidently much too late. Research shows that many children begin using alcohol as young as 9 or 10. A substantial percentage of these children (especially those who are biochemically prone to addiction) go on to experiment with illegal or prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Parents should therefore begin warning their children about the perils of drug use when they are 5 or 6 years old.</em></strong> Begin by teaching them the dangers of prescription medication: Warn them sternly to never take pills that are given to them by friends or strangers as this could lead to serious health consequences. Tell them to only accept medication from their parents or a doctor. </p>
<h2>2. Support your child’s interests.</h2>
<p>Drug use co-opts the natural “work and reward” cycle of the human brain because it provides an instant feeling of pleasure. This is why people who are unemployed or socially isolated tend to be more prone to addiction - they aren’t getting the affirmation they need to feel fulfilled, so they turn to the nearest chemical alternative. </p>
<p>Parents can use the above information to help protect their offspring from temptation: <em><strong>If your child is enjoying a healthy reward cycle, i.e., succeeding at something he’s passionate about, he will be less susceptible to drug use.</strong></em> You should therefore support your child’s hobbies and interests; encourage your child to do what he loves and remind him frequently that you’re proud of his achievements. The more involved you are in your child’s life, the better able you will be to protect him from negative outside influences.</p>
<h2>3. Provide clear, calm, and consistent discipline at home.</h2>
<p>Children have to learn early on that negative actions have consequences. If they don’t, they will be more likely to see drug use as something “harmless,” regardless of any warnings they are given by friends, teachers, etc. You are the most important authority figure in your child’s life, so it’s up to you to imbue your child with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="healthy sense of boundaries (opens in a new tab)" href="../harmful-parenting-traps/index.htm" target="_blank">healthy sense of boundaries</a>. </p>
<h2>4. Don’t hesitate to give your child a drug test if you suspect he or she
has a problem.</h2>
<p>Generally, experts recommend that parents resist the temptation to search around their child’s room, go through his knapsack, etc., as this is a deep invasion of privacy. Your child may have personal diaries and various other items he wants to keep private in his room and that should be respected. You can, however, administer a simple drug test if you’re concerned. This will confirm or rule out your suspicions quickly and easily, without invading your teen’s “space.”</p>
<h2>5. Familiarize yourself with the signs of drug addiction.</h2>
<p>There is no one “type” of drug user. Some drug-addicted teens fit the rebellious archetype while others may be quiet loners or high-functioning students who manage to mask their problem. It’s therefore a good idea to familiarize yourself with the many different changes in behaviour that can imply drug addiction. Likewise, <em><strong>if your child is behaving strangely and you don’t know why, it’s always worthwhile to keep drug use in mind as a possible explanation. </strong></em></p>
<h2>6. Realize that addiction can happen in any family.</h2>
<p>Addiction can strike anyone, regardless of their social, economic, religious, or cultural background. Many parents want to believe that their child could “never” fall victim to drugs, but this denial invariably does more harm than good. Remember that it <em>can</em> happen to your child, but he need not be alone in the process: If you’re aware that he’s struggling, you can help. </p>
<h2>7. Remain vigilant for signs of bullying and abuse.</h2>
<p>Children who have been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bullied at school (opens in a new tab)" href="../what-to-do-when-child-is-bullied/index.htm" target="_blank">bullied at school</a> or abused by family friends or relatives have a higher risk of addiction. If your child seems frightened to go to school or be alone with a specific adult, take his or her fears seriously - it could be a sign that something dangerous is going on. Remember that bullies and abusers often threaten their victims into keeping the abuse a “secret,” so your child may hesitate to tell you about the abuse directly.</p>
<h2>8. Work at building up your child’s self esteem.</h2>
<p>Low self esteem and drug use are a lethal combination. Many under-confident children start using drugs to gain peer acceptance, only to end up feeling worse about themselves. The guilt and remorse that comes with hiding their drug use, lying about it, and stealing to support their habit further destroys their fragile self-image. </p>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Healthy self esteem (opens in a new tab)" href="../child-self-esteem/index.htm" target="_blank">Healthy self esteem</a>, on the other hand, has a protective effect against drug use. Confident children are less desperate for peer acceptance and have an easier time saying “no” to others. </p>
<h2>9. Never use drugs with or around your children.</h2>
<p>If your children see you using drugs, even legal or “soft” drugs like marijuana, they’re going to want to emulate your behaviour. As such, you should never do drugs in front of your children. Furthermore, it goes without saying that you should absolutely never do drugs <em>with </em>your children, not even if they’re in their late teens. (Remember that even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="marijuana can cause significant harm (opens in a new tab)" href="../teen-marijuana/index.htm" target="_blank">marijuana can cause significant harm</a> to the brains of those under 21 and its use should not be encouraged.)</p>
<p>As a final note, if you suspect that your child is using drugs, seek help from an addiction specialist or other mental health professional immediately. Never wait for the problem to get better on its own or assume your child is just going through a “phase.” Addiction is far more treatable if it’s caught in its early stages, so getting help quickly is of the essence. </p>
