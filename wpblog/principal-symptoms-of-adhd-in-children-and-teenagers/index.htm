          <p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent mental health problems affecting children in the United States. It is widely discussed in popular mental health articles, and it seems that parents all think they know how to tell if their child is showing the telltale signs of ADHD: trouble focusing, low grades, disciplinary problems at school, and an inability to sit still. However, ADHD is a complex disorder, and there are many more symptoms than the well-known ones listed above. In order for a mental health professional to diagnose a child with ADHD, they must have shown six symptoms of the disorder for more than six months at a level that is both interfering with their functioning and is not typical for their gender and developmental level. Moreover, these symptoms manifest differently across children, thus only an experienced clinician can make a reliable diagnosis.</p>
<p>ADHD symptoms are classified into two subgroups:<strong> inattention and hyperactivity / impulsivity</strong>. Children who have symptoms that are primarily related to their ability to maintain attention would be diagnosed with Inattentive Type ADHD.  This is what used to be called ADD, or attention deficit disorder. Children whose symptoms are primarily related to hyperactivity or their ability to regulate their impulses may be diagnosed with Hyperactive-Impulsive Type ADHD.  There are also children who show signs of both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and who would be diagnosed with Combined Type ADHD. Six of the many possible signs that your child has ADHD that are not often mentioned in popular psychology articles or in the news are described below.</p>
<p>There are three symptoms of ADHD in the inattention section that are best described together. The first of these is that the <strong>child does not seem to listen when is spoken to</strong>, even if there is no obvious distraction present. Parents, teachers, or even siblings and peers may notice this, but not realize that it is a symptom of ADHD. It is easy to dismiss this sort of behavior as your child being “spacey” or living in their own world but, if other symptoms of ADHD are present, it may be a symptom of a serious mental health problem. A second symptom of ADHD that is often not discussed is the <strong>tendency of a child to lose items</strong> that they need for activities or tasks. Again, this does not immediately seem like a symptom of ADHD, but it is another symptom of the child’s inability to focus. A third symptom, that goes along with the second, is that the child often has <strong>difficulty organizing belongings, tasks, and activities</strong>. It is expected that children make a mess, and even that they are disorganized to some extent. However, if you are noticing that your child seems to find organization impossible, whether it be with his toys, his schoolwork, or his bedroom, that may be a sign of ADHD.</p>
<p>There are also three symptoms of hyperactivity/ impulsivity that may have escaped your parental radar. The first of these is if the child is often <strong>unable to play or engage in activities quietly</strong>. While some noise during play is expected of children, the child who seems to be loud regardless of whether he is coloring, playing with toys, or playing videogames, may be displaying a sign of a larger issue. A second symptom of clinical hyperactivity or impulsivity is if the child often <strong>blurts out the answers to a question before the other person is done talking</strong>, or if they complete people’s sentences for them. This symptom occurs because the child cannot wait for their turn to talk. The third symptom from the hyperactivity/ impulsivity section is if the child often talks excessively. This is sometimes considered charming in children. However, if the child seems to be unable to remain quiet and not talk in situations where incessant talking is inappropriate, it may be a symptom of a clinical issue such as ADHD.</p>
<p>While it is, of course, tempting to do detective work online to determine what is going on with your child, it is always best to see a mental health professional if you are concerned that your child has ADHD. A study was done to see if mothers accurately rated ADHD symptoms in male children, and found that they were not very accurate in classifying behaviors as ADHD symptoms, especially if symptoms of other disorders were present, such as anxiety or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). With instruction, many mothers increased their ability to correctly classify ADHD symptoms, but were still not very accurate at being able to tell the difference between children with ADHD alone or those with comorbid disorders such as anxiety or ODD. Because <strong>at least a third of children with ADHD have a comorbid disorder, such as anxiety or depression</strong>, it is especially important that these symptoms be identified as well. Essentially, no matter how educated the parent is on ADHD and its symptoms, it is also incredibly important to seek the help of a mental health professional for their opinion, diagnosis, and treatment plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">            This does not discount the importance of a parent’s observations and knowledge of their child in the diagnosis process. <strong>The observations of the parents are critical, as are those of the teachers, and the clinician. Each sees the child in a different context, and therefore may be best able to identify problem areas in their context of familiarity.</strong> However, as studies have demonstrated, parents need instruction and further education on ADHD symptoms and how they are displayed in children in order to make an accurate assessment of their child’s behavior. Your observations as a parent are critical, especially if you notice some of the symptoms described above in addition to the more obvious signs of ADHD, such as trouble focusing on homework, trouble remaining in their seat during class, or disciplinary problems for disruptive behaviors at school. If you notice more than a couple of the symptoms of ADHD in your child, your child may have a genuine problem and should be seen by a mental</p>
