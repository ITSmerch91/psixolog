<title>Content by: Lisa Aro</title>

<meta name="description" content="Lisa Aro and her husband Mark had always known they wanted to have a large family. They didn&#039;t know anything about ADHD or the effect it would have on their household. In the end, Lisa&#039;s husband Mark and five of their six children would end up with an ADHD diagnosis. One night Mark came home from work to find one very tired, very stressed out wife. She&#039;d spent the day trying to keep all six kids focused. It was like sitting on a stack of bowling balls – they just kept rolling off in different directions. As she and Mark were talking about the day she looked at him and said, “If you&#039;re king of the castle then I must be the queen of the distracted.” After a good laugh he elbowed her softly and hinted, “You know, that would be a great title for a book.” Over the years Lisa has seen so many families struggle to get a handle on life with ADHD. Juggling all the adjustments that have to be made in parenting, dealing with family and friends, and working with schools and teachers. She remembers what it was like to find relief in understanding the diagnosis but not really know how or what to do next. As a family, they decided to share their life and experiences with ADHD so other families, both parents and children, could know they weren&#039;t alone in their experience. Giving support, sharing knowledge, strategies, help, and a good laugh has always been Lisa&#039;s goal.">
