          <p>When most people think of a child with ADHD, they imagine a precocious youngster who never stops moving and rarely stops talking—a child who, in other words, embodies extreme extroversion. Nine times out of ten, this mental image depicts a little boy. Indeed, many parents who are not deeply familiar with ADHD are quick to point out how closely behaviours associated with this disorder resemble an intensified version of typical boyish conduct. It’s therefore little wonder that research indicates up to six times more boys than girls are referred to clinics for <a href="../../psychological-assessments/adhd-assessments.php.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADHD testing</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this gender bias works against female ADHD sufferers. While it’s true that more boys than girls are affected by ADHD, the male to female ratio is believed to be about three to one, not six to one. We can therefore safely assume that a substantial portion of the female population is <strong><em>living with untreated ADHD</em></strong>. Because these young women don’t exhibit <a href="../principal-symptoms-of-adhd-in-children-and-teenagers/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“typical” ADHD traits</a>, they are simply never referred for testing.</p>
<p>This is highly problematic because ADHD affects more than just a child’s ability to concentrate in class. Investigation into the emotional lives of girls with a history of untreated or poorly managed ADHD has shown that <strong><em>these young women are at increased risk of developing depression, disordered eating patterns, and low self esteem</em></strong>. This is particularly likely if their condition remains undiagnosed when they enter their preteen years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Redefining ADHD</h2>
<p>ADHD is not a personality type; it’s a medical condition that affects a person’s <a href="../child-executive-functioning/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive functioning skills</a>. Initially, hyperactive and impulsive behaviours were believed to be its primary hallmarks, and it was thought to overwhelmingly affect young men. However, research conducted during the 1980s revealed that a percentage of boys diagnosed with ADHD showed symptoms of inattentiveness <em>without</em> displaying overt hyperactivity or impulsivity. Researchers therefore had to update the definition of ADHD, and today it includes three different types:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Inattentive type</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Hyperactive/impulsive type</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Combined inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive type</p>
<p>            Further research has shown that while the <strong><em>hyperactive/impulsive type of ADHD is rare in girls</em></strong>, the inattentive type is far more common than many people realize. Unfortunately, the inattentive type is much harder to detect and diagnose, in both boys and girls. Not only are children with inattentive ADHD quieter and less disruptive than their hyperactive peers, they frequently use their intelligence to mask the signs of their condition. Indeed, an inattentive type child may achieve average or even decent grades. At the same time, however, she’ll be struggling with both the academic and <a href="../adhd-child-anger/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotional aspects of her condition</a> and she will be unable to perform at her full potential.</p>
<p>Even girls who <em>do</em> have the hyperactive/impulsive form of ADHD often fly under the radar, so to speak. For one thing, these girls are often still less impulsive than boys with the same form of ADHD, thanks to developmental differences between the sexes. (Boys with hyperactive/impulsive ADHD show a reduction in brain volume in areas of the brain responsible for impulse regulation and fine motor control. Girls with hyperactive/impulsive type ADHD show less impairment in these regions, probably because the female brain matures more quickly.)</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong><em>hyperactive girls sometimes manifest their excess energy socially rather than physically</em></strong>, making them seem like the archetypal bubbly “social butterfly.” These young women appear jovial and functional enough that they, too, often end up suffering in secret. Furthermore, despite their friendly demeanour, these girls may actually have difficulty maintaining friendships. Girls with ADHD often experience more strained interpersonal relationships than boys with ADHD, probably because girls are expected to meet higher standards of conduct. Qualities like attentiveness, patience, listening, and care-taking are disproportionately assigned to young girls. Ergo, while an outgoing young woman with ADHD will usually make friends easily, she will also struggle to keep them. This can lead to feelings of deep hurt, rejection, and unworthiness.</p>
<p>Due to the factors outlined above, it’s not unusual for ADHD to go undiagnosed in girls until they reach puberty. At this juncture, surging hormones and a rapidly-changing brain can cause girls with ADHD to become truly disruptive for the first time. Some parents describe their daughter as having “erupted” virtually overnight, going from being a relatively docile child to being one who is outwardly rebellious and extremely restless. Alas, even if a parent suspects that his or her child is acting out due to ADHD, they will usually be denied a diagnosis. The current diagnostic criteria for ADHD state that a child <strong><em>must display obvious symptoms prior to age seven in order to receive an ADHD diagnosis</em></strong>. Adolescent girls are therefore often <a href="../bipolar-disorder-or-adhd-can-your-child-be-misdiagnosed/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorrectly diagnosed with a personality disorder</a>. Meanwhile, boys with ADHD—who are usually identified and treated early in life—actually settle down and become more cooperative as they enter their teen years.</p>
<p>When girls with ADHD remain undiagnosed well into adolescence, their problems only intensify. Teen girls tend to repress and internalize their feelings, and this leads to an even higher risk of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, these young women often attempt to deal with their feelings of rejection in unhealthy ways. They are more likely to <a href="../teen-marijuana/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engage in substance abuse</a>, <a href="../mental-disorders/binge-eating-disorder/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binge eating</a>, and <a href="../sex-talk-children/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promiscuous sexual behaviour</a> than their neurotypical peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Getting Help for Girls with ADHD</h2>
<p>While ADHD is often hard to notice in young girls, it’s certainly not impossible to recognize. Today, a number of innovative diagnostic tools are being developed in order to facilitate earlier detection of female ADHD sufferers. Detailed questionnaires, for example, are now used to help girls self-report their symptoms. Better therapies, such as group therapy, individual coaching, and family therapy, are also available to treat ADHD in boys and girls alike. If you suspect your child has ADHD, you should therefore strongly consider taking her to see a mental health professional who is well-versed in the latest methods for detecting and treating this challenging condition.</p>
