          <p>At some point, every parent has to deal with disrespectful behaviour from his or her child. Whether it’s something as minor as ignoring your requests or as upsetting as a string of curses and insults, your child will sometimes express himself in unproductive ways. When this happens, first and foremost you must understand that you’re not alone and your child’s behaviour is not your fault. Furthermore, know that with the right approach, <em><strong>disrespectful behaviour can usually be corrected</strong></em>.</p>
<p>While defiance is unpleasant, it’s usually not a cause for alarm: Your child is probably just trying to work through feelings of frustration and powerlessness. As children grow older, they often feel confined by rules and expectations. They desire more autonomy but they’re not sure how to get it; as such, they act out as a means of asserting control over the situation. If your child doesn’t want to do his homework, for example, he might try to draw you into a lengthy argument. If he succeeds, he’ll be getting his own way (albeit temporarily): You’ll both be so busy arguing about his attitude that his homework will become an afterthought.</p>
<p>However, while it’s important to <em><strong>recognize and facilitate your child’s need for independence</strong></em>, you should never condone or encourage hurtful, rude behaviour. The key to managing a disrespectful child lies in allowing him a healthy measure of autonomy while simultaneously curbing inappropriate methods of self-expression. The five tips below should help you strike such a balance:</p>
<h2>1. Don’t take your child’s behaviour personally.</h2>
<p>The more you internalize your child’s words and actions, the more likely you will be to overreact. This both escalates the situation and encourages your child to keep behaving disrespectfully. After all, by showing your child that he can get a rise out of you, you’re proving to him that his techniques are effective.</p>
<p>Instead, most experts recommend that you let the “little things” (such as sighs and eye rolls followed by obedience) slide altogether. Furthermore, you should objectively analyze which of your child’s disrespectful behaviours are really disruptive. Focus on correcting these behaviours through the use of calm, <a href="../effective-discipline-methods-parenting/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="consistent discipline (opens in a new tab)">consistent discipline</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Model respectful behaviour for your child.</h2>
<p>Where do kids get the idea that acting in a disrespectful way solves problems? Usually by observing someone they respect using similar methods to handle their annoyance and upset. One of the best ways you can curb disrespectful behaviour is therefore to demonstrate healthy <a href="../help-your-child-manage-anger/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="anger management strategies (opens in a new tab)">anger management strategies</a>. Avoid speaking badly about others behind their backs and <em><strong>be polite and courteous in front of your children even when you’re dealing with a difficult person</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>3. Don’t give your child “permission” to be disrespectful.</h2>
<p>Although no parent intends to encourage their child to be disrespectful, some do unwittingly condone this behaviour—until it’s aimed in their direction. Think, for example, of the following situation: Your child is being given a truly burdensome amount of homework by one of his teachers. Naturally, you sympathize with his plight. So, when he starts complaining about how unfair his teacher is, calling her names and otherwise making a fuss about her, you agree with him (at least in part). What message do you think your child will receive if you do this? He’ll understand that it’s acceptable and even helpful to treat someone disrespectfully when you don’t agree with him or her.</p>
<p>A better way to handle these kind of situations is to, as a first step, <em><strong>empathize with your child</strong></em>. Validate his feelings, e.g. by saying, “I understand that you’re feeling tired and frustrated right now; that’s okay.” Once you have done this, <em><strong>remind him that while his feelings are acceptable, being rude is not</strong></em>. Discuss respectful ways you and your child might handle the situation, such as by going and having a polite discussion with the teacher about her homework policies.</p>
<h2>4. Remind your child of the good he does.</h2>
<p>Many parents who are dealing with an especially defiant child try to rectify the situation by becoming increasingly strict. In doing so, they forget how important <a href="../happy-successful-child/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="positive feedback (opens in a new tab)">positive feedback</a> is to guiding and correcting behaviour: Your child has to know what he’s doing right or he’ll have no positive behavioural goals to aim for. Furthermore, constant criticism will make your child resentful of you.</p>
<p>When your child does make an effort to obey you, reward him with praise. Likewise, you should proactively look for good things your child is doing. If your child doesn’t lose his temper when dealing with a moody sibling, for example, tell him that you noticed his act of self-restraint and are proud of him.</p>
<h2>5. Don’t try to force your child to respect you.</h2>
<p>As tempting as it is to assert yourself by saying, “I’m the parent, so you have to respect me!” demanding respect from your child is likely to backfire. Why? <em><strong>It’s simply impossible to make someone respect you,</strong></em> so you’re setting yourself up for failure when you make these ultimatums.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to control how your child feels about you, keep the focus on his behaviour. Remind him that while he may not like a rule, he has to comply with it, and calling you names won’t change that. Emphasize the fact that rudeness is wrong, no matter how one is feeling.</p>
<h2>What To Do If Disrespectful Behaviour Intensifies</h2>
<p>The five strategies above should be sufficient to curb, or at least manage, most cases of mild to moderate disrespectful behaviour. In some rare cases, however, a child’s defiant behaviour may continue to worsen. If this happens to you, it’s important to recognize that your child’s persistent, severe acting out may be symptomatic of a deeper issue (such as a <a href="../../ca/conditions/conduct-disorder.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Conduct Disorder (opens in a new tab)">Conduct Disorder</a>). Seek support from other parents and the assistance of a mental health professional in the event that your child’s behaviour becomes truly unmanageable. With the correct treatment, your child should be able to stabilize and overcome his issues with authority.</p>
