          <p>Should you medicate ADHD child or not? There are many doctors, parents, teachers, psychologists, and complete strangers who will give you their experiences and opinions about medication for <a style="line-height: 1.4em;" title="Principal Symptoms of ADHD in Children and Teenagers" href="../principal-symptoms-of-adhd-in-children-and-teenagers/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> (ADHD). There are those who swear by medication and those who believe it is tantamount to child abuse. Either way, it is an extremely personal decision that cannot be made for you. Every experience is unique with those who choose a natural or medical approach to treating ADHD. It is important to look at evidence from medical or scientific journals instead of the holistic mom’s blog or the rave reviews from amped up college students. Get unbiased information from your family doctor or pediatrician. Speak to your local pharmacist about common side effects they have been made aware of and about which medication might work best for you. Only after becoming fully informed will you feel confident in your choice, no matter the outcome. It is also important to remember that medication cannot teach your child new forms of behavior, such as self-control and conflict resolution; it can only create an ability to learn, but the actual teaching is better done by a counselor or therapist. Research clearly shows that the best outcome in managing ADHD is achieved by a combination of therapy and medication.</p>
<p>First, let us take a look at what medications are available and how they treat ADHD. Thankfully, there is a multitude of medications that can be used for both the hyperactive, inattentive, or mixed form of ADHD. The medications most heard about are stimulants. Stimulants, similar to the caffeine in coffee or some sodas, elicit different reaction in people who have been diagnosed with ADHD. Instead of creating a more excitable and agitated persona, the person actually becomes able to calm down and gain more focus. Stimulant medications can be short term, fast or extended release, formulas. They are considered to be very helpful and effective for most people who have ADHD. Some stimulant medications are considered safe for children as young as 3 years old with most being available to those 6 and older. Around 70-80% of patients who are on some form of medication for ADHD are using stimulant medications. They are usually preferred because you can use them as needed, they work immediately, and most side effects will subside after discontinuing medication.</p>
<p>Other medications used to treat ADHD include antidepressants, high blood pressure medication, and non-stimulant medications. Unlike stimulants, these medications are normally taken daily, take longer to begin working (i.e. days or weeks instead of an hour), and cannot be stopped abruptly due to dangerous side effects. Because these medications work to treat ADHD on a neurological and not just behavioral level, they are much more complex and could possibly be used for other disorders such as depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. These medications can be used on their own or in conjunction with stimulant medication. Usually the preference for these medications are based on the unwanted side effects of stimulants or the ease of taking one pill a day that can help many symptoms.</p>
<p>Now, how do you decide whether or not to try medication for your child? Those who use medication to treat ADHD usually have wonderful results. Grades and focus increase, impulsiveness and outbursts decrease, and their child stops getting disciplinary notes from school. This can absolutely be the case for some children and some can continue use without severe side effects. If you choose to begin medication, and this is worth repeating, get educated about the medication from unbiased sources. Side effects can include slowed physical development, the development of tics or uncontrolled movements that won’t go away once the medication has stopped, heart palpitations, anxiety, energy crashes, mood changes, unhealthy and rapid weight loss, lack of appetite, and addiction. The list of side effects for each medication will be a lot to remember but is important to be aware of. It is not necessary to tell your child all of the possible side effects but make them aware that they need to report any changes in health, behavior, or emotions. Often, knowing what side effects will occur can lead to psychosomatic reactions not related to the medication itself, in other words the child might exhibit the symptoms they were told to watch for. Some side effects can range from mild to severe and it will be up to the child’s report and your observations to determine if it is time to make a change. In some cases the positive effects of the medication outweigh the negative. Still, speaking to your doctor about all side effects is important because there may be a similar medication that can have the same effectiveness with less negative side effects. Medication can create a miraculous change in your child that leads to success in all areas and happier relationships at home and school. Remember, do not give up just because the first medication you try did not work: it is very likely that another medication or mixture of medications will be perfect for your child. Be sure to always follow the doctor’s requirements for use and especially for how to stop taking the medication if needed. Abruptly stopping medications against doctor’s advice can have permanent, and possibly dangerous, medical consequences.</p>
<p>Those who do not medicate their child will have to put the same amount of energy into research as the parent who does. Treating ADHD with vitamins, supplements, or diet can be an uphill and daily struggle in the beginning. It is still necessary to obtain testing from your doctor to see if the behavior could be due to a vitamin deficiency, food allergy, or other medical condition that can be managed without medications. Unfortunately, all that parents can do to evaluate the advertized natural remedies is to use anecdotal evidence from the internet which can be dangerous. Most “natural” or homeopathic remedies are nothing more than random and unregulated substances. Because non-prescription medications are not regulated there is no way to know what you are giving your child, what the actual dose is, or if it is harmful. If there is a nutritional imbalance, it is advisable to first change the diet to accommodate for the deficiency or use medical grade supplements or vitamins prescribed by your doctor. There are those who are able to manage ADHD without medication, especially those who have mild symptoms. It is common that there will be eventual self-medication by the overuse of caffeinated beverages, cannabis, and illegally obtained stimulants.</p>
<p>In either case, don’t feel as though you have to make one choice or the other and stick with it for life. Usually, families will move between medicating and not medicating to determine which one fits best at that time. Keep in mind, that while good results can be achieved with the use of either medication or therapy alone, it is the integrative approach that produces the best results. Finally, the child’s environment should also be adjusted both, at school and at home. The success of your child’s treatment will depend on your persistence in finding what is right and what works. If nothing seems to work, there is always the option of alternative education that caters to children who need a more flexible and engaging environment to thrive.</p>
