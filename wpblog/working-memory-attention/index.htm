          <p class="Maintext" style="text-align: left;">Few other cognitive functions have received as much attention in recent neurological research as working memory. Working memory helps us absorb and process the enormous amount of information that we are bombarded with every day. It also helps us navigate and accomplish tasks in an increasingly complex world without getting confused or overwhelmed. Simply put, working memory is the ability to keep a set of previously learned or newly acquired information in your mind for a short period of time and to be able to use this information in problem solving and task completion. Imagine that you have just looked up a phone number that you want to call and are now actively searching for your phone all the while keeping that number in mind. Once you found the phone you easily retrieve the needed number. This active dual processing was made possible with the help of your working memory. In other words, working memory is similar to the Random Access Memory (RAM) in your computer: It is used to load and quickly retrieve multiple units of data relevant for the current action or conditions. Working memory is closely related to attention, executive control, and learning.</p>
<p><iframe src="../../embed/Nls3wxRZEoE.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="Maintext" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Working memory develops gradually during childhood and is one of the first cognitive functions to decline as we age. While working memory capacity varies from person to person, most adults can hold data sets consisting of 5-9 items in their minds. However, in some individuals, the ability of working memory can be severely compromised. When working memory is weak, it is difficult to stay focused, ignore distractions, plan your next steps, remember instructions, and start and finish tasks. People with working memory deficits have selective attention problems, as it is very hard for them to extract relevant data and ignore/block unrelated information ("noise"). Weak working memory also negatively affects verbal ability (e.g. finding the right word when you need it, comprehending speech) as well as the ability to commit new information to long-term memory storage. Working memory deficits are common in individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Learning Disabilities (LD), Traumatic Brain Injury, Autism/Asperger, etc. Additionally, working memory suffers due to chronic stress, anxiety, and depression. It has become a question of critical importance for neuroscientists to find ways to improve working memory in individuals who suffer from a deficit, as well as to boost the capacity in the general population.</p>
<p class="Maintext" style="text-align: left;" align="center">If you feel that your working memory is not functioning as well as it has in the past, you might be experiencing cognitive overload. In other words, you might be trying to keep too many informational threads in your active storage. Perhaps you are engaging simultaneously in a number of different tasks while trying to keep in mind some other important information. It is easy to reduce cognitive overload by delegating some of your memory tasks to calendars, electronic schedules, written reminders and other organization aids. Additionally, it is possible to train your mind to not think about the tasks you are not currently doing. Cognitive overload is also likely to occur when a person feels worried or upset. Even if you are not aware of your feelings, your mind keeps churning the emotionally charged thoughts, thus taking up precious space in your working memory. If cognitive overload has become a chronic issue, it is a good idea to prioritize your activities and try to reduce the amount of information that flows through your mind. For example, if you find yourself thinking about work in the evenings and weekends, you can try the following: When leaving your office, imagine a cabinet with many drawers. Visualize taking all your work tasks and images (even images of people), and placing them into one of the drawers and locking it. Then visualize putting the key in your pocket. If work-related thoughts are still bothering you, visualize them and place them in a drawer again. Taking quiet relaxation breaks throughout the day is also very important, "quite relaxation" means you are not checking your messages or chatting with a co-worker. In recent decades, revolutionary research in neuroplasticity [Doidge et al., 2007] has shown that various brain functions can be trained and strengthened with carefully prescribed rigorous mental exercise [Klingberg et al., 2002]. A number of training programs were developed to improve brain functioning, such as BrainHQ, Lumosity, Cogmed, and others. Among these, Cogmed is the oldest and most widely-used system. Its primary target is to boost working memory and attention, although other benefits were also reported. Most clients report improvements in academic and professional performance as a result of stronger working memory and attention. Several empirical studies suggest that increases in working memory capacity can be accompanied by improvements in fluid intelligence ([Jaeggi et al., 2008], [Jaeggi et al., 2011] and [Klingberg et al., 2005]), reading comprehension ([Chein and Morrison, 2010] and [Dahlin, 2010]), math competence [Holmes, Gathercole, &amp; Dunning, 2009], and ADHD symptoms ( [Gibson et al., 2011], [Holmes et al., 2010] and [Klingberg et al., 2005]).</p>
<p><iframe src="../../embed/j-Pojkqekq0.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="Maintext" style="text-align: left;" align="center">Cogmed is different from other training programs, in that it was developed by empirical researchers (Karolinska Institue, Sweden, 2001) and is backed by over 30 peer-reviewed research studies published in independent scientific journals. It has been used extensively in the US and Canada since 2006 and its effectiveness is supported by ongoing scientific <a href="../../working-memory/research.html">research</a>. Overall, research indicates that 80% of individuals who complete Cogmed Working Memory Training experience significant improvements in their working memory and attention, which are often accompanied by positive changes in their daily functioning. This training is effective for children and adults of the general population, as well as ageing persons and individuals with such conditions as ADHD, Autism, LD, Traumatic Brain Injury, etc. Not everyone is a good candidate for this training and, in some cases, the training can be counter-indicated. This is why Cogmed training can only be administered by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist who will assess the candidate’s suitability and insure proper adherence to the program. Today, Cogmed Training is owned and managed by Pearson Assessments, a leading publisher of psychological assessment and therapy materials. It is delivered through a network of trained and licensed professional all around the world. Here you can read more information about the <a href="../../cogmed.php.html">Cogmed training</a>.</p>
