          <p>Schizophrenia is one of the most complex disorders to treat and to understand. There is a great level of diversity in the symptoms and they will vary greatly from person to person, and even from day to day in the same individual. Only 1% of the population is known to have Schizophrenia but the chances of developing the disorder is increased in families with a history of the illness. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that not only affects the individual but it also creates complications in family and community life. While some may embrace their disorder as a part of them that helps in creativity or decision making, many are debilitated by the disorder and must always be cared for by another. Someone with Schizophrenia might have times in which independence is possible if they are strict about treating and controlling symptoms. Independence is also a possibility in those with mild symptoms that do not interfere greatly with daily life. Although rare, Schizophrenia can have an early onset in childhood but is normally seen to emerge during the late teen to early adulthood.</p>
<div class="block blue">
<h3>Causes</h3>
<p>The cause of Schizophrenia has been a source of confusion for the mental health community for decades. There is clear evidence that the brain of a sufferer is different than someone without the disorder. A genetic component is likely but certain occurrences may trigger the illness in some while not affecting others within a family. There is always new research being conducted to determine the cause and a reliable treatment for Schizophrenia.</p>

</div>
<div class="block orange">
<h3>Types</h3>
<p>Symptoms become evident sooner in men than in women in most cases and occur between the ages of 16-30. Often, in teenagers, the symptoms go unnoticed or the child is afraid to report changes in mental and emotional functioning. Signs that your child is developing the disorder are unusual thought processes that don’t have a logical flow, new feelings of paranoia or being untrusting of family and friends, isolation, irritability, and otherwise abnormal behavior. The person may seem to have lost touch with reality and may begin speaking to or responding to voices and objects that you do not see. Symptoms are categorized as being positive and negative. Positive symptoms are described as those symptoms that are outwardly noticeable and occur in addition to normal behaviors. They include all forms of hallucination and delusion, as well as thought and speech disruptions and movement disorders. Speech patterns may become jumbled and incoherent with words that are made up or out of order. Movements might include repetitive motions that resemble agitation or annoyance with things not seen by others. Negative symptoms include those that seem to take away from the personality of the person with the disorder. They are not as noticeable and might be mistaken for depression. Some negative symptoms include a change in cognitive function, lack of desire for fun or pleasurable events, monotone speech and lack of facial expressions, and becoming sedentary. Some sufferers must be cared for in a facility where 24 hour care and observation is available while some lead generally functional lives with little disruption. Those with untreated Schizophrenia have the chance of becoming a danger to themselves and others.
</p></div>
<div class="block green">
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment for Schizophrenia consists of a constantly changing regiment that is appropriate for the symptoms occurring during that time. The focus of treatment is usually on the most debilitating symptoms or those that are considered dangerous or harmful. Medication is often used for controlling&nbsp; the symptoms but it might need to be changed from time to time as it becomes ineffective. There are specific medications for delusional disorders but this often only helps with hallucinations and delusions. Other medication may be used for cognitive or movement concerns. This often leads the sufferer to become confused about, or frustrated with, the number of medications and they may choose not to take them. The side effects of multiple medications may also lead someone to refuse medications due to preferring the symptoms over the side effects. Professional and experienced mental health practitioners must be available from the start of symptoms. Counseling can help in reducing emotional disturbances from the disorder and can help the client manage their life and care more effectively.
