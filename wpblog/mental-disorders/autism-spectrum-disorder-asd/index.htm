          <p>Autism awareness has reached an all time high with most people having someone with Autism in their family or a close friend with a child with Autism. Autism Spectrum Disorder is an umbrella term that covers those with mild to severe Autism or Asperger’s Syndrome. It is estimated that 1 in 88 children are born with a form of Autism.</p>
<div class="block blue">
<h3>Causes</h3>
<p>The increased incidence of Autism is likely due to better diagnostic tools and more awareness of parents. For many years, it was assumed that some vaccine additives were to blame for causing Autism but that was recently debunked when the scientist responsible for the report retracted his data. Current research has pointed to a genetic mutation that causes Autism Spectrum Disorders. An older than average age of the child’s grandfather at the time their father was conceived has a high correlation of Autism as well. There is also a higher chance that a child will be born with Autism if a parent has Autism or if a sibling was born with the disorder. Currently, there is a blood test being developed to detect Autism in the general public. Previously, there was evidence of some brain differences that could be seen in functional MRI data. Autism can be diagnosed in children as young as 2 years old, often when parents notice a difference in normal developmental behaviors. A family doctor may be able to give you a diagnosis but a psychiatrist or psychologist will be able to provide a definite answer and course of treatment.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="block orange">
<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<p>There are four general criteria needed to determine the presence of an Autism Spectrum Disorder. The first symptom is some form of social deficit in all environments that is not due to a developmental delay. This means that the child must have difficulty or an inability to have a reciprocal conversation in which there is an appropriate “back-and-forth” where the child shares personal thoughts or emotions appropriate to the conversation. There will also be deficits in non-verbal socialization which could mean a lack of eye-contact, facial expressions, or body language that does not fit the context of the interaction. Another social deficit will include a difficulty in making and maintaining peer and caretaker relationships. Imaginative play with companions will be difficult and playing alone may be preferable for the child. The next criteria include specific repetitive behaviors, or noticeable patterns in interests or activities. This behavior can be noted as a physical repetition such as flapping one’s hands or rocking back and forth. It can also manifest as verbal repetitions such as repeating a phrase or noise repeatedly. A child with Autism Spectrum Disorder will often have the desire to follow very strict routines and may become frustrated if that routine is disrupted. This also pertains to fixations on objects and their placement. Loud noises, flashing lights, and chaos may create a lot of discomfort for a child with Autism while some may become upset with silence. The pain tolerance of a child with this disorder may also be much higher than other children. It is not unusual for a child to harm themselves and not complain or report the injury. It is necessary that these symptoms be present from early childhood, or when social demands make them apparent, and impairs the functioning of the child.
</p></div>
<div class="block green">
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment will likely be a part of the child’s life long term depending on the level of severity. Mild Autism may require some support at home and school but the child’s difficulties can be handled without much resistance. This level of severity may be successful with a school aide and some at home skills training. A child with moderate Autism will need substantial support meaning the child does not always respond well to skills training or redirections. This level of Autism may require a special time out room for when behaviors become disruptive in class. An aide in school will likely be necessary for the entire school day with an in home aide for most days of the week. A child that has severe Autism may be nonverbal and unable to function in a mainstream classroom. They will likely require special education class for the entire school day and may need in home health care to help with life skills. It is important that the caretakers utilize the help available in their area because burn out can cause tension and resentment in the home.
