<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Gender Dysphoria, previously known as Gender Identity Disorder, is a diagnosis that can be applied to children, adolescents, and adults. It is no longer considered a disorder due to gender identification not being a mental illness. There is an important difference between gender and sex that needs to be understood prior to understanding this diagnosis. A person can be born male, female, or in some cases, have both male and female sexual organs, or have too many or missing sex chromosomes. Alternately, the gender of a person is based on how they interact with their environment and their personal preferences. A young boy might prefer doing things that are seen as feminine by society including wanting to wear make-up or dresses and preferring toys that are marketed to girls. This can also be the case for young girls that refuse the societal norms that are expected of them. Although the feeling of being a gender that differs from what is expected can cause distress, it is usually not a problem inherent to the person. The problem usually occurs because the family, friends, or community members are not comfortable with the display of behaviors that are contrary to the sex of the person. Without societal norms, a person with Gender Dysphoria, allowed to live as the preferred gender, would have little to no discomfort surrounding the preference.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Symptoms of Gender Dysphoria must be present for at least six months to be considered significant. In children, there must be verbalization about the desire to be of a different gender since they are not in full control over items purchased for them that would allow for expression of the preferred gender.&nbsp; Signs that someone is dealing with Gender Dysphoria are a strong desire to be treated as the opposite sex, asking to be called by a different name, dressing in ways that are consistent with the opposite sex, and attempting to hide sex identifying physical features. For females, you might notice that they cut their hair very short in traditionally male hairstyles, they might use binding wraps to conceal breasts, or wear baggy clothing to hide their feminine form. They may also use a deeper tone when speaking and try to apply facial hair or use makeup to create the illusion of facial hair. In males, there could be a desire to wear feminine clothing and undergarments, they may wear makeup or nail polish, and attempt to appear more like a woman. They might speak in a higher pitched voice and might remove body and facial hair to appear more feminine. The distress that accompanies Gender Dysphoria could be from an acute level of depression or anxiety to feelings of suicide. Bullying and family stigma can often cause the person to hide behaviors so that they are accepted or to isolate themselves from others. In some cases the desire to be the opposite sex might lead to gender reassignment surgery or other forms of plastic surgery to appear more like the preferred gender. In some cases, the severity of the disorder might allow for insurance coverage of hormone therapy or the desired body modifications.

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment for Gender Dysphoria is an important part of allowing those with this diagnosis to deal with the emotional and social ramifications of their gender identity. Therapy is often used so that the client has someone to talk to who can professionally asses the severity and determine the appropriate interventions. Choosing a therapist who is certified to work with this disorder is very important. Employing a mental health professional who is unable to provide unbiased and nonjudgmental care could only serve to worsen the condition and could lead to more severe outcomes. It is ultimately up to the client, and the family if the client is a minor, to decide if hormone therapy and eventual surgery is right for the individual.
