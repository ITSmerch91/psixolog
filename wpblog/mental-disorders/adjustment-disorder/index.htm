          <p>Adjustment Disorder is a form of general diagnosis for those that do not have symptoms severe enough to be considered mentally ill.</p>
<div class="block blue">
<h3>Causes</h3>
<p>Anything that causes stress can cause an Adjustment Disorder. Being sick with the flu, moving, getting married, having a child, difficulty in school, or a visit from family. The problem arises when someone reacts to these types of stressors in a way that could be considered exaggerated. People of all ages can have an Adjustment Disorder but the symptoms only last less than 6 months. If the symptoms continue for longer than 6 months it is likely that the stress may have brought to light a different disorder. In children, Adjustment Disorder occurs equally in males and females but in adulthood women suffer from this disorder more often than men. Children and teens are at higher risk of Adjustment Disorder due to the high level of stress involved in normal development but the lack of skills to deal with these life changes. In adults, Adjustment Disorder can happen if there are multiple stressors present at the same time that disrupt work, school, or home life in a significant way. This can also be an issue for adults and children that live in unstable homes or dangerous neighborhoods. Without treatment, it is possible that an Adjustment Disorder can resolve on its own or develop into a more severe condition.

<div class="block orange">
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Symptoms of Adjustment Disorder may look like someone going through an emotional time. Basically, that is what Adjustment Disorder is. Consider how a person would generally react to a very stressful situation. You would likely see crying, nervousness, agitation, aggravation, anxiety, worry, sleeping too much or insomnia, and a generally stressed demeanor. A child with this disorder will likely become stubborn and easily irritated. Signs of the stress might include behavioral changes such as picking fights, mistreating pets, becoming impulsive, skipping school, and experimenting with drugs and alcohol. This is also true for adults but might include not paying bills, not going to work, driving recklessly, and relationship struggles. Someone dealing with this disorder may attempt to isolate themselves but it is important to continue giving support, encouragement, and care without enabling the behavior. Sometimes all that is necessary to get someone through an Adjustment Disorder is listening to their frustration and offering support.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="block green">
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment for Adjustment Disorder usually is necessary if the change in behavior occurs for longer than 6 months or if the disruption by the behavior is troublesome. Treatment is usually non-intensive and short term. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is often used to help the person deal with the stress, control emotions, and learn relaxation. Often it is helpful to learn skills to deal with future stressors to keep the disorder from reoccurring. If there is a fear that the person is suicidal or has attempted suicide it may be necessary to arrange for inpatient care but this is rare. For children, play therapy can be used to help recreate stressors and practice solution building. Sometimes it is helpful to use medication for short term symptom relief and to reinforce confidence that will be developed in counseling. If the environment is chaotic or dysfunctional it is helpful for the family to attend counseling together. When there are stressors in the community, such as bullies or dangerous neighborhoods, it could be helpful to find supportive networks within the community and learn how to develop a feeling of safety and security in the home. If there is bullying, or cyber bullying, by peers, the school administrators should be made aware and school counseling could also be helpful. Generally, Adjustment Disorder will improve over time if the person feels supported by loved ones.
