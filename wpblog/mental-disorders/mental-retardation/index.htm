          <p>The intelligence quotient, or IQ, test has been a common tool in academic communities to determine the ability of a person to learn. It has been misused most often to segregate students of different backgrounds into separate learning environments. The proper use of IQ testing allows for schools to determine the educational needs of an individual and to meet those needs at a level that is appropriate for their ability. Although the average score of an IQ test has changed over the years it is still used as a standard to determine Intellectual Disability. You might hear Intellectual Disability being called mental retardation, developmental delay, or severe learning disability. The generally accepted term is intellectual disability in academic and mental health communities. Intellectual Disability does not mean that the child is unable to learn but that different approaches must be used to foster learning.<br>
Commonly, a child with an IQ near or below 70 is considered to have a disability. This qualifies the child to have educational support and depending on the severity may also qualify for in home services. Intellectual Disability can be caused by many factors. A child born with Down Syndrome will be Intellectually Disabled due to a chromosomal abnormality, while children born with Autism may not have a clear cause. This disability can also occur due to brain injury or abnormality at birth or later in life. IQ is generally stable from early childhood into adulthood with little significant fluctuation unless there is a disruption in development or functioning of the brain. In the case of a child that is mistreated or neglected the IQ can increase once appropriate living conditions are provided. Generally, though, Intellectual Disability becomes apparent to caretakers when the child begins to miss childhood milestones such as speech acquisition.</p>
<div class="block blue">
<h3>Causes</h3>
<p>Some parents will know that their child will have an Intellectual Disability prior to birth while others may not know until the child is school age. Children that are exposed to alcohol, drugs, toxins, or malnutrition before birth are likely to have some difficulty with learning. Signs that your child might have an Intellectual Disability include delay in communication, motor development, or development of logic. A child that has difficulty with only one area is likely not Intellectually Disabled but may have a different syndrome or disability. Often, children may speak and comprehend as though they are many years younger than their chronological age. They may also never mature past a certain age as they grow older. There are situations where the child or adult progresses in maturity and ability but at a rate much slower than those in their peer group. Being diagnosed as being Intellectually Disabled is not considered to be globally limiting for the child. Those with the disability can still lead happy and fulfilling lives, carry jobs, and have loving relationships. Tests can be done to determine the severity of the disability and will help school personnel in determining the best care at school and home. Intellectual Disability shouldn't be confused with <a title="Autism Spectrum Disorders" href="../autism-spectrum-disorder-asd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autism </a>- please see video below for details:</p>

</p></div>
<div class="block green">
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment for Intellectual Disability generally includes specialized education. Depending on the specific issues, occupational or speech therapy may be employed. Sometimes it is necessary to get physical therapy and help learning gross and fine motor skills. Counseling could consist of life skills training, play therapy, and art or music therapy. Parents and caretakers are urged to participate in counseling to learn how to deal with the stresses involved in having a child with a disability and how to help the child adjust to life with the disability in the home. When parents discover they have a child with this form of disability there is a high likelihood that the marriage or relationship will suffer if no counseling is sought. It is usually more stressful for the family members than it is for the child to deal with the disability.
