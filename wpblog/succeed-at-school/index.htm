          <p>As necessary as education is, going to school isn’t everyone’s favourite pastime. Many children - even very <a href="../gifted-assessments/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bright children</a>&nbsp;- end up losing interest in school and treating it as something that must simply be endured. These children often voice their desire to leave the school system as quickly as possible, refusing to entertain the possibility of post-secondary education.</p>
<p>Parents of unmotivated students often try a multitude of tactics—pleading, punishing, rewarding, and so on—to encourage their children to take an interest in school, but these methods often fall short of the mark. While they may prompt a temporary improvement, creating lasting academic motivation requires a more nuanced, multifaceted approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Guide To Inspiring The Unmotivated Student</h2>
<p>Before you begin tackling your child’s apathy toward school, it’s essential that you take a moment to empathize with him (or her). Keep in mind the fact that school isn’t the most “child-friendly” environment and feelings of dislike for it are therefore fairly normal. Children are energetic, curious beings who instinctively desire the freedom to create, play, and explore; as such, the highly regimented school system feels stifling to many youngsters. It’s important to see this situation from your child’s point of view and let go of your feelings of frustration; doing so will allow you to effectively collaborate with him when developing solutions.</p>
<p>Once you have done the above, you’ll need to take a deeper look at your child’s individual reasons for developing an unusually intense antipathy towards school. By identifying the source of the problem, you can help your child to overcome his personal challenges and gradually develop more of an interest in learning. Some common causes of dislike toward education include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Low Self-Esteem</em></p>
<p>Children with low self-esteem frequently avoid anything they think they might “fail” at—including tests, projects, and assignments at school. This establishes a self-defeating cycle that’s difficult to get out of: The more a child tries to avoid doing his schoolwork (and the longer he puts it off) the more likely failure becomes. Eventually, this negative feedback loop becomes so overwhelming that the child ceases to outwardly “care” about school or bother trying at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A Lack Of Parental Support</em></p>
<p>Though most parents don’t mean to come across as unsupportive, it’s an easy enough mistake to make. Being too busy to help out with homework, for example, can make a child feel very alone with his academic struggles. Additionally, when parents don’t appear to enjoy learning themselves (voicing a <a href="../reading-to-children/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dislike of reading</a>, having closed and inflexible opinions and beliefs, etc.), children often end up mirroring this anti-intellectual behaviour.</p>
<p>Though it may sound cliche, going the extra mile to make learning seem fun can make a real difference in how your child perceives school. Activities like reading a story together at bedtime, taking trips to museums, and building models or engaging in “DIY” science experiments can help your child develop a love of learning while in a freer, more relaxed environment. This will make adjusting to school—and developing an interest in academics—easier for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A Poor Classroom Environment</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, having negative, overly critical, or disinterested teachers can suck the life and joy out of even your child’s favourite subjects. If your child used to enjoy school, then suddenly begins to express a strong dislike for the classroom environment, it’s a <strong><em>good practice to review how he’s being taught</em></strong>: Are his teachers encouraging him to succeed, or are they more focused on asserting their intellectual dominance over their students? Is your child being given meaningful and achievable tasks, or is he being provided with dull, hollow, and/or overly difficult assignments? If your child’s teachers are the source of his sudden disinterest in school, it’s <strong><em>best to change his classes, or his school entirely, before this negative attitude becomes too deeply entrenched.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An Over-Abundance Of Pressure</em></p>
<p>It’s essential that you assess how your child feels about your attempts to motivate him (and his teachers’ attempts to do the same): Does he feel inspired by your <a href="../effective-discipline-methods-parenting/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proactive parenting&nbsp;methods</a> or does he feel pressured to succeed at all costs? Remember that sensitive children can perceive even well-meaning discussions about the importance of academic success as an attempt to exert pressure or voice criticism. If this is the case, your child will need a gentler approach; otherwise, he will develop such <a href="../child-and-teen-anxiety/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance anxiety</a> that he will begin to avoid the task of schoolwork.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="../child-hypersensitivity/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sensitive child</a>, rather than placing the emphasis on his performance, try motivating him via a sense of emotional and intellectual reward. First, help him to derive feelings of enjoyment and accomplishment from his academic pursuits. Then, encourage him to focus on these feelings rather than on the concepts of absolute “success” and “failure”. Additionally, <strong><em>you should remind your child that you will love him no matter what</em></strong>. Instill the idea that he <a href="../link-perfectionism-anxiety/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn’t have to be a perfect student</a> to be perfectly adored by his parents; he just needs to be himself.</p>
<p>Regardless of the root of your child’s academic discontent, it will be important to <strong><em>focus on his strengths rather than his weaknesses</em> </strong>as you work with him to improve his motivation. By doing so, you will gradually build his confidence and reduce feelings of low self-esteem. You’ll also provide him with a rewarding sense of achievement that will propel him to seek similar rewards in the future. Remember that deep down, all children want to succeed and make their parents proud of them; some just need a bit of extra guidance and encouragement in order to walk down the correct path. <strong><em>Remain patient and positive as you troubleshoot your child’s apathy and you will undoubtedly help him find the road to academic fulfillment.</em></strong></p>
