          <p>In recent years, mindfulness has risen to prominence as
something of a psychological panacea. Current research tells us that
mindfulness exercises can reduce the symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression,
and even physical suffering. Mindfulness can also help people with learning
disabilities and developmental disorders combat the negative effects of their
conditions. What’s more, even those who are not struggling with physical, emotional,
or cognitive issues can benefit from mindfulness thanks to its general ability
to enhance positive emotions and wellbeing. </p>
<p>If you’re a parent, you’ll be happy to know that <a href="../teach-mindfulness-to-children/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mindfulness works just as well for kids as it does for adults (opens in a new tab)">mindfulness works just as well for kids as it does for adults</a>. As children get older, they tend to cease living “in the moment” and—like adults—become preoccupied with their worries, difficulties, and setbacks. Mindfulness exercises can help to prevent this gradual slide into negative thinking and empower kids with greater social and emotional awareness.</p>
<p>Of course,
children need to be taught how to be mindful using slightly modified
techniques. The eight mindfulness exercises below have been adjusted to reflect
the attention span of the average child:</p>
<h2>1. Deep breathing.</h2>
<p>This is an
excellent exercise to try when you want your child to gradually settle down for
a nap. Let your child get comfortable, then ask her to breathe deeply in and
out. Ask her to describe how her breath feels when it enters her body and when
it leaves, then have her repeat the deep breaths about five times. Once this is
complete, ask your child what thoughts or feelings she’s aware of in that
moment. If her thoughts or feelings are negative in nature, suggest that she
imagine them being trapped in bubbles. Finally, have her repeat a few deep
breaths, instructing her to imagine the “feeling bubbles” floating away as she
does so. </p>
<p>Very young
children sometimes benefit from trying this exercise with a “breathing buddy.”
Place a favourite stuffed toy on your child’s stomach so that she can more
fully see and feel the effects of each deep breath. When your child is upset,
asking her to get her breathing buddy and do deep breathing exercises together
can help her calm intense emotions. </p>
<h2>2. Mindful posing.</h2>
<p>This exercise
is a great way to help your child strengthen her mind-body connection. Ask your
child to assume different poses (such as a Superman pose, Spiderman pose, ninja
pose, monk pose, etc.) and then tell you how she feels while holding each pose.
For added effect, have your child pretend her senses are heightened by
superpowers, then ask her what she can smell, hear, see, and taste.</p>
<h2>3. The “feelings jar.”</h2>
<p>This
exercise is both a fun craft project and a useful tool for teaching emotional
awareness. To complete this project, you’ll need a jar, water, and glitter
glue. (You may add other light waterproof decorations that are “shakeable” as
well.) Fill the jar about three-quarters full with water, then add a few
generous squeezes of glitter glue before sealing the lid tight. Let your child
shake the jar and gradually watch the glitter settle back down to the bottom.</p>
<p>When your
child is angry, worried, or upset, you can have her take the jar off the shelf
and give it a hearty shake. Not only will the act of shaking the jar release
tension, your child can imagine her feelings gradually settling down as she
watches the glitter descend. Tell your child that waiting for her emotions to
settle down will help her to think calmly and clearly, just like the water eventually
becomes clear again as the glitter settles on the bottom of the jar. </p>
<h2>4. The safari of the senses.</h2>
<p>This
exercise is intended to help get kids fully engaged in (and enjoying!) the
present moment. Take your child outside and tell her to imagine that she’s on
safari. Ask her to be as quiet and stealthy as possible so that she can fully
observe every animal, bird, and insect she sees without scaring them away.
Encourage her to put her senses on high alert and notice little details (like
tiny insects in the grass) that she would usually overlook.</p>
<h2>5. Scent sensations.</h2>
<p>Collect a
bunch of pleasant-smelling items, like scented candles, flowers, herbs, fruit,
etc., and ask your child to breathe each scent in deeply. Take a moment to
pause after each item and ask your child what kind of feelings and memories
that particular scent evokes. Sensory experiences like these both orient your
child in the present and encourage her to become more aware of her thoughts and
feelings. </p>
<h2>6. Mindful strolling.</h2>
<p>Rather than
hurrying through walks to school, to the park, and so on, have your child slow
down and focus on her breathing. Try asking her what kind of things she’s
seeing, hearing, and feeling as she walks, such as the smell of the fresh air
or the sound of the wind rustling through tree leaves. </p>
<h2>7. Slow snacks.</h2>
<p>Snacks
provide another great time to slow down and fully experience the senses. Next
time your child is having a snack, ask her to first smell the food, then bite
down and chew very slowly, paying special attention to the feeling of chewing
and the subtle nuances of flavour. You should also have your child pause at the
end of the snack to reflect on the satisfying feeling of being full. </p>
<h2>8. Meditation moments.</h2>
<p>While young
children usually lack the patience needed for any kind of guided meditation,
older “gadget crazy” kids will likely enjoy the free Smiling Minds meditation
app (suitable for children 7 and up). Alternately, you can participate in short
meditations with your child to keep her engaged. Make the experience more
meaningful by spending some special one-on-one time with your child after doing
something you both enjoy.</p>
<p>If you start <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="teaching your child to be mindful early on in life (opens in a new tab)" href="../the-rewards-of-mindful-parenting/index.htm" target="_blank">teaching your child to be mindful early on in life</a>, she will eventually incorporate the practice into habit. The end result will be a happier, calmer, and more self-aware kid—one who is well-positioned to handle the challenges of adolescence and adulthood. </p>
