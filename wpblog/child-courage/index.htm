          <p>Children today are growing up under immense pressure thanks to the competitive intensity of social media. Older children and teenagers especially spend a lot of time comparing their lives to the lives of others, inevitably deciding that other people have some intrinsic quality they lack. They see other young adults <a href="../teens-and-social-media/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="leading “perfect” lives (opens in a new tab)">leading “perfect” lives</a> and decide they’re not smart enough or outgoing enough to succeed.</p>
<p>Children therefore need to be taught that no one is born automatically predisposed to being successful. Success and happiness are a product of making the right choices: For example, the choice to take a risk and approach others in the pursuit of friendship, the choice to work hard and get good grades, the choice to keep trying even when challenges make our lives difficult, etc. </p>
<p>Underlying all of these choices is one guiding light: Courage. By teaching our children to be courageous, we arm them with the tools they need to survive and thrive.</p>
<h2>8 Steps To Building Courage In Your Child</h2>
<p>Parents and children alike need to understand that courage is a learned behaviour—not something you’re born with (or not born with, as the case may be). <strong><em>Courage can be taught, built upon, and expanded over the years until it becomes a habit</em></strong>. The secret lies in learning how to be courageous early on. </p>
<p>If you’d like to get started teaching your child how to master the art of bravery, try utilizing the eight strategies below: </p>
<p>1. Explain that brave people don’t always <em>feel </em>brave
inside. Children are incredibly literal creatures. As such, they assume that if
a person is acting courageously, he or she must not be feeling fearful. They
then assume that because they do feel fearful, they are not brave. This
perception subsequently shapes their behaviour and self-image. You can prevent
this from happening if you explain that brave people are frightened even while
they are being brave—they just choose to override their fears, and it’s this
choice which is really the essence of courage. </p>
<p>You should also explain that courage comes in many different forms, many of them non-aggressive. Being nice to an “uncool” classmate in front of other students, for example, is a form of courage.</p>
<p>2. Affirm your child’s bravery. Remind your child that you
see her as brave; this will encourage her to see herself that way and reflect
it in her actions. Try saying things like, “You can do it—I know how brave you
are,” and, “I really respect how you make hard choices and do the right thing”
to show your child how you see her.</p>
<p>Even when your child is being “difficult,” you should try to
work these affirmations in. If she is arguing with you, for example, say that,
“I love that you have the courage to express your own opinions, but you would
be a lot more effective if you didn’t shout and use insults.”</p>
<p>3. Give your child permission to “mess up.” Nothing breeds timidity like a fear of failure. By telling your child that it’s okay to fail you will help her rebound when she isn’t successful. Remind your child that every time you fail at something, you learn what doesn’t work. If you keep trying, eventually you will rule out everything that doesn’t work and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="find a successful approach (opens in a new tab)" href="../encourage-gifted-child/index.htm" target="_blank">find a successful approach</a> to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should never expect flawless bravery. Let
your child know that it’s fine to hang back or take time to regroup while
getting psychologically prepared to tackle a challenging situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4. Encourage your child to try new things. Prompt your child to try a range of different activities (e.g., drama, sports, music, art), whether she thinks she will be “good” at them or not. <em><strong>Teach her that the end goal of these activities isn’t to be better than others—it’s to get to know herself better</strong></em>. Note that this also applies to allowing your child to experiment with new ideas: Don’t limit her ideologically and allow her to disagree with you.</p>
<p>Make trying new things a regular part of your family life,
too. Try new foods, go to new places, and cultivate a sense of adventure. </p>
<p>5. Set a good example. Share stories of times when you felt
scared or nervous or had to stand up for yourself against others’ opinions.
Remember, your child looks up to you and wishes to emulate you—if she knows you
have had fears and conquered them, she will try to do the same. </p>
<p>6. Allow your child to make her own decisions. As long as your child’s safety isn’t at stake, you should <em><strong>let her use her intuition to guide her own choices</strong></em>. Indeed, you should actively encourage her to follow her “gut instincts.” Parents who are too heavy-handed with advice <a href="../develop-self-confidence/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="undermine their children’s confidence (opens in a new tab)">undermine their children’s confidence</a> in their own decision-making capabilities. This causes them to hesitate more and be less courageous.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to over-protectively control your child’s choices, <em><strong>teach her how to make wiser decisions on her own</strong></em>. Tell her to examine her choices before she makes them, verifying that they will not break a rule, hurt her or someone else, and that they actually do feel “right.”</p>
<p>7. Teach your child the art of positive self-talk. The
things we tell ourselves shape how we see ourselves. If your child is continually
telling herself that she “can’t” or “shouldn’t” do the things she wants to do,
her self-esteem will eventually suffer for it. You should therefore tell your
child to make a habit of saying, “I can” and “I should” instead. Help her
practice saying these things to herself each day until it comes naturally to
her. Additionally, you should have a family gathering each week where each
family member shares something brave they did that week.</p>
<p>8. Help your child understand that <em><strong>it’s never too late to change an outcome</strong></em>. The path to success is seldom linear, so children—being short-term thinkers—tend to get discouraged quickly when an act of bravery does not immediately lead to victory. Likewise, if your child has a prior history of being unsuccessful in a given area (such as when making friends) she’s doubly likely to succumb to defeat if initial attempts to reverse the trend do not work. You have to guide your child into seeing that bravery is a process, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. You have to teach her to repeatedly go back to the “drawing board” and think up new plans for how to succeed. Remind her that no matter what, you have faith she will get there in time. </p>
<p>Remember, courage is about <em><strong>consciously directing our lives in a way that is true to ourselves</strong></em>—not grand, periodic gestures of heroism. Every day, your child is fighting the monsters of self-doubt, peer pressure, fear, and anxiety. Let her know that you’re there for her and that, with your support, there’s nothing she can’t accomplish.</p>
