          <p>Rates of self-harm among teenagers have risen sharply over the last two decades, and emerging research suggests that teenagers with <a href="../principal-symptoms-of-adhd-in-children-and-teenagers/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> (ADHD) are especially vulnerable to engaging in this poorly-understood behaviour.</p>
<p>In order to begin to understand this complex problem, it is necessary to first examine self-harm itself and figure out the reasons why some teenagers engage in acts which physically harm them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Self-Harm?</h2>
<p>Self-harm is defined as any act wherein individuals attempt to relieve pain or distress by <a href="../cuttin-self-harm/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harming their bodies</a>, either by cutting or burning, hitting themselves (or walls or other hard objects), pulling their hair, or biting. More rarely, young people may attempt to poison themselves or overdose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why are Some Children Prone to Self-Harm?</h2>
<p>According to research, the primary causes for self-harming behaviours are generally impulsivity, <a href="../helping-your-teen-cope-with-depression/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depression</a>, and low self-esteem. These factors may be biological, or arise as a consequence of unusual stress and pressure at home or at school. Likewise, it is known that during adolescence, girls become four times as likely as boys to self-harm.</p>
<p>The first clue as to why ADHD and self-harm are linked lies in the spectrum of emotions experienced by children who self-harm; many report strong feelings of guilt, frustration, anger and impulsivity—all emotions which are more prevalent in those who have ADHD. (Where ADHD has not been diagnosed, feelings of failure and low-esteem are often particularly acute.)</p>
<p>Children and teenagers who self-harm are often attempting to <a href="../emotional-regulation-children/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take control of their feelings</a>; they <strong><em>see these destructive acts in an oddly positive light, believing that they are capable of relieving the sensations of intense pressure and pain inside them</em></strong>. One can view these actions in the light of attempted preventative therapy: Rather than let negative emotions build up until they become overwhelming, resulting in the largest destructive act possible (suicide), these young people seek to release their pain through engaging in many smaller destructive acts.</p>
<p>New findings from UC Berkeley (published in the <em>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</em>) may shed light on why the <strong><em>rate of self-harm is so much higher for adolescent girls with ADHD than for boys</em></strong>. The study, which took place over a ten-year period, revealed that girls with histories of ADHD are more prone to internalize their struggles and feelings of failure. As self-harm is, at its root, a way of expressing internalized pain (as those who engage in these acts see them as “harmless”, because they are not hurting anyone but themselves), it logically follows that those with ADHD who choose to internalize the associated feelings of anger, guilt, depression, etc., would be more prone to self-harming behaviours as well. This study also showed that girls do not simply “outgrow” ADHD and its associated risks; those with combined inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity during childhood were found to be at much <a href="../teenage-suicide-warning-signs-prevention/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher risk of self-injury and suicide</a> attempts in early adulthood.</p>
<p>These findings have been corroborated by similar Australian studies which also found that girls with ADHD not only internalize their feelings more than adolescent boys typically do, they also tend to exhibit more internalizing disorders as compared to girls without ADHD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Frequency of Self-harm in Adolescents with ADHD</h2>
<p>ADHD is thought to affect 5-7% of all children, and it is now proved that ADHD symptoms tend to persist into adulthood. According to recent research, ADHD is often a precursor to low self-esteem and poor academic and job performance, making it a significant public health issue.</p>
<p>A survey of the ISC data bank which analyzed the link between ADHD and self-harm, looking specifically at children and adolescents between 5–15 years who had a “diagnosis of external causes of injury and poisoning” (AKA self-harm), found that the <strong><em>likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD was about four times higher among children and adolescents hospitalized due to suicide and self-harm</em></strong>. Patients who were admitted to hospitals because they had attempted suicide or self-harmed were six times and three times more likely to be diagnosed with ADD, respectively, as compared with other causes of injury. The rates of self-harm in total were discovered to be about 8.5 times higher for children diagnosed with ADHD (as compared to individuals without ADHD).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while self-harm often begins as a means of preventing suicide, the ISC data bank survey also confirmed existing knowledge linking self-harming tendencies to a greatly increased risk of suicide.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Identifying Self-Harm</h2>
<p>It is often very difficult to identify children and adolescents who self-harm, as many become very skilled at concealing their behaviour. However, teenagers who seem excessively shy and self-conscious, who cover up even on hot days and refuse to partake in any activity (e.g. swimming) where they might have to expose a large amount of skin, ought to be watched carefully for signs of self-harm.</p>
<p>Likewise, frequent signs of scratching, bruising, or scarring should be treated with due care, as should finding any suspicious sharp object (such as a razor blade) in your child's room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Preventing Self-Harm</h2>
<p>In those with ADHD, the <strong><em>key to preventing self-harm often lies in <a href="../../psychological-assessments/adhd-assessments.php.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosing and treating the ADHD as soon as possible</a></em></strong>. Additionally, parents and educators should be sure to focus on the child's positive achievements; never place undue attention on his or her learning disability in a solely negative light, but rather try to manage it while also encouraging the child and pointing out those areas where ADHD can also benefit the learning process. The more confident the child feels, the less likely he or she will be to engage in self-harming behaviours. If depression and poor self-esteem arise irrespective of your best efforts, seek professional help for your child as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Managing ADHD in the Classroom (for teachers and support workers)</h2>
<p>Therapists are likewise often useful in helping to create teaching strategies that teachers can use in the classroom to make the ADHD student's experience smoother and more enriching. This is very important in the prevention of self-harm as a great deal of a child's confidence and self-esteem is typically dependent on his or her academic performance. Some of these strategies include:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <strong><em>Not taking things personally</em></strong>. Teachers must understand that the student's outbursts are not personal or intentional; usually, the student simply cannot help it. Feelings of anger and frustration need to be set by the wayside so that teachers may help these students flourish.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <strong><em>Remaining vigilant for those times when the child seems focused</em></strong>. If a child is on medication, it's best to be sure to work with the child while the medication is in his or her system. If the child is not on medication, look for moments when he or she seems particularly calm and attentive and try to engage him or her then.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <strong><em>Identifying distractions</em></strong>. To a young person with ADHD, apparently “normal” things like being seated near a door or window may prove extremely distracting. Additionally, earplugs ought to be suggested if the classroom is frequently noisy, or if the teacher giving instructions during an assignment is actually making it more difficult for the child to focus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <strong><em>Setting appropriate boundaries</em></strong>. While it's important to be understanding when a child has ADHD, educators should not simply abandon rules and boundaries altogether; indeed, children with ADHD are in particular need of this structure. Make sure, however, that you give reprimands privately, and take the time to listen to the student when he or she has genuine concerns about a requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, however, that <strong><em>you should not punish restlessness</em></strong>; children with ADHD cannot help this. Provide them with a means of fidgeting (e.g. using a stress ball) which minimizes distractions for others, and assign to them any “active” duties that arise in the classroom, such as the task of wiping off the chalk board.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <em><strong>Breaking down tasks</strong></em>. Children with ADHD frequently have impaired planning and organization skills, meaning that they cannot easily plan and carry out tasks in the correct order. To help them work around this, provide checklists with each assignment so that tasks are already broken down into logical segments, starting with the first priority item. Get the child to recite to you how they believe the assignment should be completed, after reviewing the checklist, in order to make sure that he or she is properly understanding the information provided.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <strong><em>Being clear when giving instructions</em></strong>. Children with ADHD retain information best when it is given to them in a clear, concise way (specific, not vague) while eye contact is maintained. Additionally, you should not rely on verbal instruction alone; have the child write notes or provide a written checklist detailing instructions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- <strong><em>Providing a peer mentor</em></strong>. An older child with ADHD can be a very valuable resource when paired with a younger one, protecting that child against bullying and giving him or her an understanding companion and positive role model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the prevalence of ADHD and self-harm alike are continuing to rise, it is essential that parents and educators verse themselves on how to detect, treat, and manage these conditions. <em><strong>Through early intervention and positive learning strategies, the risk of self-harm can be substantially lowered, and children with ADHD can grow up feeling a confident mastery of their unique abilities.</strong></em></p>
