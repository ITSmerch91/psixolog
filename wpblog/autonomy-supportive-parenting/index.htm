          <p>The journey of childhood is defined by the transition from a
state of complete dependence to one of personal autonomy. To achieve healthy
independence, kids need to be taught how to feel comfortable with every aspect
of who they are. This is especially important for <a href="../child-and-teen-anxiety/index.htm">children with
elevated anxiety levels</a>. They must be provided with enough structure to
make them feel secure, but not so much structure that their ability to make
decisions is curtailed. Practicing autonomy supportive parenting is one way to
achieve these goals with minimal stress.</p>
<h2>What is Autonomy Supportive Parenting?</h2>
<p>Autonomy
supportive parenting is essentially
a parenting style where parents intentionally involve their kids in making
decisions and performing actions, of course in age-appropriate and safe ways.
For instance, when deciding on extra-curricular activities for her child, a
mother can offer a few options, explain what each of them involves, and visit
the activities with her daughter. She then can ask her to pick the one she wants
to sign up for. This will help the child to feel personally involved,
increasing a sense of commitment and responsibility. It will also teach the
child how to make wise decisions by listening to her feelings and gathering
information. Finally, it will build her sense of confidence and self-respect. Though parenting always involves a certain amount of
intuition, developing a parenting style is an excellent way to make
child-rearing choices more consciously and intentionally.</p>
<p>Autonomy
supportive parenting, like balanced parenting, eschews <a href="../../ca/blog/thinking-about-kids/201409/authoritative-versus-authoritarian-parenting-style.html">extremes
of permissiveness and authoritarianism</a>. This parenting style cultivates a
middle ground where children are supported without being overly protected or
limited. It definitely does not mean allowing the child to have what she wants
and when she wants it at all times. Instead, it encourages self-awareness,
active thinking and decision making within the appropriate limits set by the
parents.</p>
<h2>How to Practice Autonomy Supportive Parenting</h2>
<h3>1. Provide unconditional love.</h3>
<p>Unconditional
love is vital for many reasons, but it’s especially important to the
development of confidence. Children who know they will be loved even if they
“mess up” have less fear of failure. This empowers them to take measured risks,
try new things, and build strong peer connections.</p>
<p><em>Ethan was bullied in
the past, and has become very fearful and dependent on his mother for solving
any problems with peers. His mother intervened at the slight hint of any
conflict by speaking to his teacher and principal. This only made Ethan feel
more ineffective and helpless. After realizing that this does not help the
mother decided to change her tactic. She still actively participated in
discussions when Ethan wanted to share about his problems, helped him better
understand the situation and think about possible solutions, but suggested that
he tries to work it out on his own first. Of course, Ethan did not always
succeed, but the mother told him she was very proud that he tried. Gradually,
he became better at communicating with his peers, more confident that he can take
care of himself, and less fearful of bullying. </em></p>
<p>Demonstrating
unconditional love is more complicated than simply caring about your child
consistently (which, of course, most parents already do). For kids to know
they’re accepted at all times, they need to be spoken to in a calm,
non-judgmental way, even when they misbehave. When you must correct your
child’s behaviour, focus on addressing the problem at hand without labeling
your child. For example, if your daughter neglects to pick up her toys, don’t
call her “messy” or “lazy.” Gently remind her that her toys are all over the
floor, then explain that she needs to pick them up so that no one trips over
them.</p>
<h3>2. Give your child the opportunity to make age-appropriate choices.</h3>
<p>Kids learn
how to make good decisions via trial and error. Allowing your child to make
choices that influence her daily routine, even when she’s very young, is an
excellent way to build <a href="../../kids/responsibility/teaching/teaching-your-kid-to-make-good-decisions/index.htm">better
decision-making skills</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re
parenting a toddler, start with small choices that are easy for your child to
understand. Asking your child whether she prefers to use a red cup or blue cup,
or what order she’d like to get ready for bed in, will encourage her to start
thinking about how she can independently shape her environment. Just make sure
that the choices your child is able to make align with her level of maturity
and don’t compromise her well-being. For instance, it’s unwise to ask a small
child whether or not she wants to go to bed on time or brush her teeth,
however, she can choose which book you will read her at bedtime. Things that
are related to health and safety should be controlled by parents and the
reasons for parental decisions should be explained (e.g., it's good to go to
bed on time so you don't feel
tired tomorrow).</p>
<p>Parents
should also respect their child’s preferences (where possible) and allow kids
to do things at their own pace. Asking a child about her preferences makes her
pay attention to her feelings and tells her that they are important and
accepted by others. This lays a foundation for healthy self-esteem.
Acknowledging a child's preference even if you cannot accept it is very
important too. If on a cold winter day your child wants to go outside without a
jacket you can say  "I understand
you wish it was summer and we did not need our jackets anymore. I feel the same
way but today it's still cold and we both need to wear them". If your
toddler wants to dress herself, bathe herself, or complete another achievable
task, don’t intervene and attempt to speed up the process (unless she asks for
help). You can, however, help your child by structuring the task. For example,
you can lay out the clothes for her to wear, or you can make a list of tasks
she needs to do when washing herself before bedtime and stick it to the
bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>During playtime, support your
child’s desire to explore and experiment—don’t dictate activities. For example,
if your child wants to change the rules for a game, ask her what the new rules
are, try to use them, and then ask the child how she liked the game with the
new rules.</p>
<p><em>Danny often cheated in games. Telling him that this is wrong and that
nobody will want to play with him did not help. Then, one day his father told
him: I see that you want to change the rules a bit. It looks like you want
cheating to be allowed in this game. Lets play it this way and see how we like
it. When both of them were cheating the game became meaningless and Danny
decided he did not like it. This approach helped Danny discover for himself
that rules make games interesting, without adults shaming or threatening him.</em></p>
<p>As your child gets older, you can begin to involve her in discussions about rules and limits. Though only parents can <a href="../set-limits-for-child/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">establish household boundaries and routines</a>, asking your child how she feels about proposed consequences will facilitate communication and collaboration. For example, you may say to your child: <em>I know you really like to play video games, but it is hard for you to know when to stop. What can I do to help you make it easier when your time is up? What should I do if you ignore my request to stop? Do you know why it is important to set a limit on fun activities?</em></p>
<p>Make sure she knows that you’re working together to create a
more harmonious and functional household (i.e., rules don’t exist simply to
give parents a reason to punish their children). You should also consider
helping out when you see your child truly struggling in a specific area, such
as by helping her plan how and when to complete challenging tasks. <em>For example, if your child has difficulty
cleaning her room, help her schedule an appropriate time for doing it, then,
together, create a check-list of tasks that need to be done and ask her if
there is any task she does not know how to do. For the first time do it with
her, helping her to follow the plan. Help her feel good about accomplishing
this by pointing out how nice and clean her room is now.</em> Of course, this is
more time consuming than simply stepping in and doing it for the child. However,
in the long run, this approach will lead to a child who is not only capable of
doing many daily tasks for herself, but also has confidence that she can master
new tasks in the future.</p>
<h3>3. Help your child feel valued and competent.</h3>
<p>Part of
making good decisions lies in knowing those decisions mean something to the
people around us. Children need to feel like they’re contributing to the family
unit in a positive way to stay motivated and maintain a sense of direction. For
example, if you routinely involve your child in discussion of vacation plans
for the family, she will feel as an important member of a family and will learn
to seek decisions that meet everybody's needs.</p>
<p>When your
child is small, take the time to allow her to “help” you complete tasks,
provided that they don’t involve anything dangerous or breakable. Don’t treat
your child like she’s getting in the way. As she matures, give her a list of
manageable chores to complete each week and provide her with specific reinforcement,
such as fun time with parents. This also teaches kids about positive
consequences of their actions: since she completed her chores, the parents now
have some free time which they can spend together.</p>
<p>Instead of just giving her a reward for “being good,” tell
her that by completing a certain chore, she allowed you to relax or focus on
another task. Let her know how much you value her contributions to the
household, in addition to providing rewards or privileges.</p>
<h3>4. Demonstrate empathy and employ active listening skills.</h3>
<p>Kids often
have difficulty recognizing and expressing their feelings, which can hinder
their ability to act on their desires in a productive, independent way. Empathy
and active listening are therefore key components of autonomy supportive
parenting.</p>
<p>When you’re
interacting with your child, genuinely listen to her perspective, especially
when she’s upset or confused about something. Validate her feelings before you
correct her behaviour, such as by saying, “I understand why you’re angry, but
it’s not okay to throw things.”</p>
<p>When you’re working together to
solve problems, ask your child open-ended questions, like, “How can I help you
feel better?” or “What would you like to do about this?” Your primary goal when
guiding your child should be to help her explore her own emotions and opinions
within safe boundaries.</p>
<p>Never reject or dismiss your
child’s feelings. It may seem ridiculous to you that your child is crying over
getting one scoop of ice cream rather than two scoops, but the hurt she is feeling
is real to her and we, as parents, need to acknowledge that hurt instead of
brushing it away.</p>
<p>If you would like to try this approach, take a few moments
to reflect on your own parenting style and that of your partner. Observe how
you make decisions, communicate them to your children, and listen to their
input. Together with your partner, decide what you'd like to change and start
with a few simple goals. Consistency between caregivers as well as from day to
day is very important. Do not be surprised if your child does not react in the
way you'd expect at first.
Practice your new skills by accepting her right to react in her own unique way.
Gradually, it will become easier and less effortful for both of you. As
your children grow it is helpful and necessary to re-consider parental
boundaries from time to time, in order to allow them to learn how to shape
their life and take responsibilities for their choices.</p>
<p>Autonomy supportive parenting aims to create a cooperative
bond between you and your child while maintaining secure, sensible behavioural
boundaries. If you’re not sure how to identify or change your parenting style,
you may want to consult a family therapist. The objective insight provided by a
therapist can help you make the transition to autonomy supportive parenting
more smoothly and consistently.</p>
