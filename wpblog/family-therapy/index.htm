<p>Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy that seeks to improve the interpersonal dynamics between family members. Family therapy can be beneficial to diverse groups of people who share a familial bond, including parents and children, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, and caregivers or friends that are closely connected to the family unit. Regardless of group composition, the goal of family therapy is to improve communication, alleviate ongoing tension, and help families cope with periods of grief or change. This is accomplished by treating the entire family “system” rather than focusing on individual pathology; i.e., the family’s connections, processes, and patterns are strengthened to improve functioning of the unit as a whole.</p>
<p>Though family therapy is administered from a group perspective, the presence of multiple family members is not always required during sessions. A family therapist can provide you with strategies to resolve conflict and correct unhealthy patterns even when one or more family members are unwilling to participate in therapy. Family therapy is defined by its group-oriented analytical framework and systems approach, not by how many family members are present throughout the course of therapy.</p>
<h3>When to Seek Family Therapy</h3>
<p>The reasons people pursue family therapy are as diverse as families themselves. Family therapy is frequently recommended for families confronting any of the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major life changes; e.g., moving, divorce, unemployment, the arrival of a new baby, or caring for an elderly relative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chronic conflict or domestic violence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Traumatic experiences, such as the loss of a loved one or a natural disaster.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Someone in the family is suffering from a mental or physical illness, struggling with substance abuse, or experiencing disordered eating.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A child in the family is having academic or social difficulties at school.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, if there’s a situation in your family that’s causing you to feel deeply upset, angry, concerned, or confused, family therapy might be right for you.</p>
<h3>Types of Family Therapy</h3>
<p>Family therapy is a highly specialized discipline that requires specific training, credentials, and experience. Make sure you select a Registered clinical Family and Marriage Therapist (RMFT) to perform this kind of counselling. Depending on your needs, your therapist will recommend one of the following forms of therapy:</p>
<p><strong>Bowenian</strong>: Initially developed by Murray Bowen, Bowenian therapy is ideal for use in situations where only one family member can be present during therapy. This form of family therapy focuses primarily on the concepts of triangulation and differentiation: Triangulation describes the practice of involving a third party in problems or disputes in an attempt to dissipate frustration, relieve anxiety, and balance the dynamic. Differentiation, on the other hand, is the process of reducing emotional reactivity by learning to separate thoughts from feelings. Differentiation also involves building a sense of self that is not wholly defined by family processes and beliefs, without losing connectedness within the family. By increasing differentiation, patients can avoid harmful patterns of triangulation and confront family issues more directly.</p>
<p><strong>Structural</strong>: Salvador Minuchin’s structural therapy model seeks to create balance within the family system by addressing role conflicts and hierarchy issues. The therapist accomplishes this by “joining” with individuals and subsystems within the family to fully understand their dynamics, discover obstacles, and catalyze change. (For instance, the therapist might join the subsystem of a mother and her children to examine why they oppose the disciplinary style of the father.) Structural therapy can effectively correct power imbalances, such as when parents or guardians are struggling to enforce boundaries with minors in the home, or when one sibling is bullying another.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic</strong>: Systemic therapy examines challenges from the context of how individuals within the family unit relate to one another. In this model, families are viewed as systems where each member’s behaviour unconsciously influences the behaviour of other individuals within the group and the group as a whole. Rather than focusing on the power of specific individuals within the group, a therapist administering systems therapy will consider the influence of the system on each individual. Then, he or she will help the family recognize the driving forces behind patterns of conflict and consciously engineer change.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic</strong>: Strategic therapy provides a viable option for families who wish to address a specific issue without committing to a lengthy course of therapy. Based on concepts developed by Jay Haley and Cloe Mandanes, strategic therapy involves assessing the family’s power structure, communication style, and central problem (or “symptom”), then assigning homework for the family to complete. Family members are asked to set well-defined, measurable goals that gradually transform their problem into an opportunity for positive growth. During this process, they are often encouraged to temporarily engage in more of the problem behaviour, thereby drawing attention to its role in the family dynamic. The therapist serves as an unbiased authority figure to ensure that no one family member controls the interaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="block blue">
<h3>What is the Goal of Family Therapy?</h3>
<p>All forms of family therapy work to create a more understanding, supportive family dynamic and facilitate healing. The goal of this type of therapy is to give each family member the tools they need to shift their behaviour and perspective, thereby creating the foundation for lasting peace and stability at home.</p>
<p>Some of the specific objectives achieved during family therapy may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting boundaries is critical to family harmony, particularly after a family’s composition changes. For example, therapy can be used to resolve boundary disputes between parents and grandparents who live together. This process may include providing equitable access to shared resources, or dissolving grandparent-grandchild coalitions that undermine parental discipline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Altering unhelpful communication styles</li>
</ul>
<p>A common goal of family therapy is to correct defensive, hostile, passive-aggressive, or avoidant communication patterns. This may take the form of encouraging family members to express their feelings to one another more directly. Alternately, the therapist may need to shift communication away from blaming a single family member for the family’s problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a family culture of empathy and respect</li>
</ul>
<p>Cultivating empathy is crucial when, for instance, one family member is struggling with a physical or mental illness. In this situation, the therapist will help other family members understand the impact of the patient’s illness and provide effective support. The therapist may also help the family learn to manage caregiving duties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning better conflict resolution and problem-solving skills</li>
</ul>
<p>A variety of issues (such as religious, racial, and cultural differences) can contribute to enduring conflict within families. To break this cycle, a family therapist will help individuals on both sides of the issue understand one another, find common ground, and achieve compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving connection and cohesion among family members</li>
</ul>
<p>Family cohesion can be jeopardized by divorce, separation, and the formation of blended (step) families, among other causes. Family therapy can help divorced and blended families adjust to their new roles and relationship patterns, as well as enhancing connection and understanding between family members.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overcoming grief and trauma</li>
</ul>
<p>Family therapy analyzes the long-term effects of grief and trauma through the lens of family relationships. It provides a safe space for families to come to terms with their experience, identify their triggers, and develop healthy coping skills. Family therapy is particularly important for traumatized children, as children require family support to rebuild their sense of security and identity. Family therapy can also address secondary trauma, which frequently affects the parents (or guardians) of primary trauma victims.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<h3>What is Involved in Family Therapy?</h3>
<p>The process of family therapy varies depending on the needs of the patient(s) and the type of therapy being performed. In all cases, however, patients must be prepared to invest significant time and effort into therapy. Typically, attending formal sessions and completing regular homework assignments is required to master new skills, change entrenched habits, and establish healthy patterns of interaction. Putting learned techniques into practice at home each day is crucial to the success of family therapy.</p>
<p>Patients should expect to attend anywhere from 12 to 20 formal sessions with their therapist. During these sessions, several family members will usually be present at the same time to allow the therapist to assess the family’s dynamic. Individual sessions and larger group sessions may also be provided, as needed.</p>
